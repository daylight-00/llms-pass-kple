            "66": "## ⑤\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nParaquat selectively accumulates in the lungs due to the specific distribution of polyamine transporters. These transporters are highly expressed in alveolar epithelial cells, allowing paraquat to enter these cells more readily than other cell types. Once inside the cells, paraquat undergoes redox cycling, generating reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative stress and ultimately lead to cell death. This selective toxicity to the lungs is the reason why paraquat poisoning is often fatal.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\n* **① Selective expression of CYP2D6:** CYP2D6 is an enzyme involved in drug metabolism, but it does not play a role in the selective toxicity of paraquat.\n* **② Low expression of P-glycoprotein:** P-glycoprotein is a drug efflux pump that can prevent the accumulation of certain drugs in cells. However, paraquat is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein, so its low expression does not explain the selective toxicity.\n* **③ High activity of Na+,K+-ATPase:** Na+,K+-ATPase is an enzyme involved in maintaining the electrochemical gradient across cell membranes. While it is important for cellular function, it does not play a role in the selective toxicity of paraquat.\n* **④ High activity of glutathione peroxidase:** Glutathione peroxidase is an enzyme that helps protect cells from oxidative stress. While paraquat does cause oxidative stress, the high activity of glutathione peroxidase in alveolar epithelial cells does not prevent the toxic effects of paraquat. \n",

This approach is supported by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. \n\nTherefore, changing the umeclidinium/vilanterol inhaler to vilanterol/fluticasone inhaler is the most appropriate measure for this patient. \n\nHere's why the other options are not as suitable:\n\n* **① Add oral theophylline:** Theophylline is not recommended as a first-line treatment for COPD due to its potential for side effects and drug interactions. \n* **② Add fluticasone inhaler:** Adding a separate fluticasone inhaler would be less convenient for the patient and may increase the risk of side effects. \n* **③ Add oral azithromycin:** Long-term macrolide antibiotics like azithromycin are not routinely recommended for COPD treatment unless there is evidence of frequent exacerbations. \n* **⑤ Change umeclidinium/vilanterol inhaler to umeclidinium inhaler + fluticasone inhaler:** This option would not provide the benefit of a LABA, which is important for symptom control in COPD. \n",

However, the ferritin and transferrin saturation levels are still below the reference range, suggesting iron deficiency. Therefore, adding oral ferrous sulfate is the appropriate course of action to address the iron deficiency and further improve the patient's hemoglobin level. \n\nHere's why the other options are not appropriate:\n\n* ①: Decreasing the dose of epoetin alfa is not necessary as the patient is responding to the current dose and has iron deficiency.\n* ②: Increasing the dose of epoetin alfa is not necessary as the patient is responding to the current dose and has iron deficiency.\n* ③: Switching to epoetin beta is not necessary as the patient is responding to epoetin alfa.\n* ⑤: Adding intravenous ferric hydroxide sucrose complex is not necessary as oral ferrous sulfate is the preferred route for iron supplementation in non-dialysis patients. \n",

It is a good option for this patient because it is effective and has a relatively low risk of side effects compared to other NSAIDs. \n\nHere's why the other options are not as suitable:\n\n* **① Tramadol:** While Tramadol can be effective for pain relief, it is an opioid and carries a risk of addiction and abuse. It should be reserved for patients who have not responded to other pain medications.\n* **② Vitamin D:** Vitamin D deficiency can contribute to osteoarthritis pain, but it is unlikely to be the sole cause in this case. Additionally, the patient's vitamin D levels have not been checked, so it is unclear if supplementation is necessary.\n* **③ Duloxetine:** Duloxetine is an antidepressant that can be used to treat chronic pain, including pain associated with osteoarthritis. However, it is not as effective as NSAIDs for pain relief and has a higher risk of side effects.\n* **⑤ Diclofenac:** Diclofenac is another NSAID that is effective for pain relief. However, it has a higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects than Celecoxib, especially in patients with a history of ulcers or kidney problems. \n\nTherefore, Celecoxib is the most appropriate medication to add to the patient's current regimen. \n",

In this case, although the patient does not have a FLT3 mutation, midostaurin has shown to improve outcomes in patients with t(8;21) AML, regardless of FLT3 mutation status.\n\nTherefore, the combination of cytarabine + daunorubicin + midostaurin offers the best chance for long-term remission and survival in this patient.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* High-dose cytarabine (option ①) is typically used for patients with high-risk AML or those who have not achieved complete remission with standard-dose therapy.\n* Arsenic trioxide + idarubicin (option ②) is a treatment option for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is not the case for this patient.\n* Venetoclax + azacitidine (option ③) is a treatment option for elderly patients with AML or those who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy.\n* Mitoxantrone + cladribine + cytarabine (option ④) is a less commonly used consolidation regimen for AML.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of post-remission therapy should be individualized based on the patient's specific characteristics and risk factors.

He is currently using a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), aclidinium. \n\nBased on the GOLD guidelines for moderate COPD with significant symptoms, the next step in therapy is adding a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) to the LAMA. \n\nTherefore, the appropriate drug therapy plan is to change the aclidinium inhaler to formoterol/aclidinium, which is a combination of a LABA and a LAMA. \n\n**Rationale for other options:**\n\n* ① Adding fluticasone inhaler: While adding an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) could be considered, the GOLD guidelines recommend a LABA/LAMA combination as the preferred option for moderate COPD with significant symptoms. \n* ② Adding oral roflumilast: Roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor that can be used for moderate to severe COPD with chronic bronchitis. However, it is not recommended as the first-line add-on therapy for moderate COPD. \n* ③ Adding oral azithromycin: Long-term macrolide therapy is not recommended for COPD due to the risk of antibiotic resistance and other adverse effects. \n* ⑤ Changing aclidinium inhaler to beclomethasone/formoterol: This option would add an ICS/LABA combination, which is not the preferred choice for moderate COPD with significant symptoms according to the GOLD guidelines. \n",

This suggests that the current insulin regimen may not be adequately controlling postprandial hyperglycemia. \n\nTherefore, the most appropriate action is to **increase the evening dose of insulin lispro**. This will help to better manage the blood sugar spike after dinner. \n\nThe other options are not as appropriate:\n\n* **① Maintain current medication regimen:** This may not adequately control postprandial hyperglycemia.\n* **② Decrease the dose of insulin glargine:** This could lead to increased blood sugar levels throughout the day.\n* **③ Increase the morning dose of insulin lispro:** This may not be necessary as the pre-breakfast blood sugar level is already within the target range.\n* **⑤ Change the administration time of insulin glargine to bedtime:** This may not be as effective in controlling postprandial hyperglycemia. \n",

Ciprofloxacin is a potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4 enzyme system, which is responsible for metabolizing warfarin. As a result, the combination of both drugs may lead to increased levels of warfarin and, therefore, an increased INR.\n\nSince the patient has been taking ciprofloxacin for the past 5 days and plans to discontinue it today, it is likely that the increased INR is due to the drug interaction. Therefore, the appropriate action would be to skip one dose of warfarin and remeasure the INR to assess the effect of discontinuing ciprofloxacin on the patient's coagulation status.\n\nTransfusion of fresh frozen plasma (①) would not be appropriate, as there is no evidence of bleeding or coagulopathy. Administration of coagulation factor VII (②) would also not be appropriate, as the patient's INR is not low enough to warrant this intervention.

The most appropriate treatment option among the given choices is a topical corticosteroid, which helps to reduce inflammation and manage the symptoms. Hydrocortisone 1% cream is a suitable option for mild to moderate cases of atopic dermatitis.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for this case:\n① Mupirocin is an antibiotic used for skin infections, not for atopic dermatitis.\n② Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive agent used for severe atopic dermatitis cases, but it is not the first-line treatment for mild to moderate cases.\n④ Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent used for more severe cases of atopic dermatitis and is not a topical treatment.\n⑤ Methylprednisolone is an oral corticosteroid, which is not the preferred treatment for atopic dermatitis, as topical corticosteroids are more effective and have fewer systemic side effects.<|im_end|>",

Therefore, the pharmacist should consult with the prescriber to confirm the appropriateness of the prescription.\n\nThe other options are not selected for the following reasons:\n① 정장제 캡슐 (Probiotic capsule): Probiotics are generally considered safe and are not a concern for DUR consultation.\n② 세티리진 정 (Cetirizine tablet): Cetirizine is a common antihistamine and does not require DUR consultation unless there are specific concerns or interactions.\n④ 아세트아미노펜 정 (Acetaminophen tablet): Acetaminophen is a common pain reliever and fever reducer, and the dose prescribed is within the recommended limits for children.\n⑤ 피메크로리무스 크림 (Pimecrolimus cream): Topical medications like pimecrolimus cream for skin conditions typically do not require DUR consultation unless there are specific concerns or interactions.<|im_end|>",

The appropriate pharmacotherapy for COPD includes the use of inhaled corticosteroids, such as budesonide, to reduce airway inflammation. Budesonide is an inhaled corticosteroid that is commonly used in the management of COPD.\n\nOther options are not as appropriate for this patient:\n① Salbutamol is a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) that provides quick relief of symptoms but does not address the underlying inflammation in COPD.\n③ Prednisolone is an oral corticosteroid that may be used for acute exacerbations of COPD but is not the first-line therapy for chronic management.\n④ Salmeterol/fluticasone is a combination inhaler containing a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroid, respectively. While it may be used in some COPD patients, it is not the first-line therapy for initial management.\n⑤ Tiotropium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) that helps with bronchodilation but does not address inflammation, and roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor that may be used for treating COPD with a significant airway inflammatory component, but it is not the first-line therapy for initial management.<|im_end|>",

The current medication includes hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, which is appropriate for initial management. However, the patient's blood pressure is still not well-controlled (>130/80 mmHg), and the presence of proteinuria (ACR 240 mg/g) indicates a need for better blood pressure control.\n\nRamipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is the most suitable choice for this patient because it has been shown to reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of CKD, in addition to its antihypertensive effects. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the preferred first-line agents for patients with CKD.\n\nThe other options are not as appropriate:\n\n③ Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker, which can be used as an additional agent if the blood pressure is still not well-controlled, but it does not have the renoprotective effects that ramipril provides.\n\n④ Carvedilol is a beta-blocker, which may be considered in some cases, but it is not the first choice for patients with CKD due to its limited renoprotective effects.\n\n⑤ Increasing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide may be considered, but it is generally less effective than adding a renoprotective agent like ramipril.\n\n① Continuing the current medication without addition is not suitable, as the patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled, and there is proteinuria present.<|im_end|>",

The clinical examination results show an HbA1c of 7.8%, fasting blood glucose of 155 mg/dL, and a postprandial blood glucose of 195 mg/dL, indicating poor glycemic control. The lipid panel shows a total cholesterol of 175 mg/dL, LDL-C of 95 mg/dL, and TG of 150 mg/dL, which are slightly elevated. The eGFR is 76 mL/min/1.73 m^2, indicating normal kidney function.\n\nThe patient is already on metformin for diabetes management, lisinopril for hypertension, carvedilol for hypertension and angina, atorvastatin for lipid management, and aspirin for cardiovascular protection. The patient's LDL-C is slightly elevated, and considering the patient's history of coronary artery disease, it would be appropriate to intensify the lipid-lowering therapy with a more potent statin like rosuvastatin.\n\n① Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker, which could be considered for hypertension, but the patient is already on a beta-blocker (carvedilol) and an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), making the addition of a third antihypertensive agent less likely.\n② Clopidogrel is a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor used for platelet inhibition in patients with coronary artery disease. However, the patient is already on aspirin, and adding clopidogrel would not be the first choice for further platelet inhibition.\n④ Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic drug, but the patient is already on metformin, and adding another oral antidiabetic agent is not the first choice.\n⑤ Empagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which could be considered for additional glycemic control; however, rosuvastatin is a higher priority for this patient given the history of coronary artery disease and slightly elevated LDL-C.<|im_end|>",

In this case, the patient is experiencing dystonia as a side effect of haloperidol treatment. Benztropine can help alleviate the symptoms of dystonia by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in muscle contraction. The other options listed are not primarily used for the treatment of dystonia:\n\n① Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).\n② Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders.\n③ Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist used to treat nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal motility disorders.\n⑤ Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist and prokinetic agent used to treat gastrointestinal motility disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and delayed gastric emptying.<|im_end|>",

However, it can cause side effects such as constipation, which can be a particular concern for patients who are already immobile or have reduced gastrointestinal motility, such as those who have undergone surgery.\n\nOpioid-induced constipation can be managed with various medications, including laxatives, stool softeners, and prokinetic agents. However, in this case, the most appropriate option is octreotide, a somatostatin analog administered as an injection. Octreotide works by inhibiting the release of gastrointestinal hormones that stimulate the production of fluid in the intestines, thereby reducing constipation. It is often used in patients with opioid-induced constipation that does not respond to other treatments.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for this specific situation:\n① Mesalazine is used for treating inflammatory bowel disease, not for managing morphine-induced constipation.\n③ Psyllium is a bulk-forming laxative, which can be used for constipation but is less effective in cases of opioid-induced constipation.\n④ Bisacodyl is a stimulant laxative and can be used for acute constipation, but it is not the first choice for managing chronic opioid-induced constipation.\n⑤ Dioctahedral smectite is a clay-based agent used for its adsorbent properties, not for treating constipation.<|im_end|>",
            "739": ": ⑤ 태아의 체내에서 생성된 Rh 항원에 대한 IgG 항체\n\nExplanation: In the case of Rh-negative mother carrying an Rh-positive fetus, the mother's immune system is exposed to the Rh-positive fetal red blood cells. The mother's body produces IgG antibodies against the Rh-positive fetal red blood cells. These IgG antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the fetal red blood cells, leading to hemolysis and erythroblastosis fetalis.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n① 모체의 탐식세포 활성화 (Activation of the mother's phagocytes) is not the direct cause of erythroblastosis fetalis.\n② 출산 시 모체로 유입된 태아의 적혈구 (Fetal red blood cells entering the mother at birth) would not cause erythroblastosis fetalis in a subsequent pregnancy.\n③ 모체의 T 세포에 의한 지연형 과민반응 (Delayed type hypersensitivity reaction by the mother's T cells) is not related to erythroblastosis fetalis.\n④ 모체에서 생성된 Rh 항원에 대한 IgM 항체 (IgM antibodies against Rh antigens produced by the mother) would not cross the placenta and would not cause erythroblastosis fetalis.<|im_end|>",
            "817": ": ②\n\nExplanation: The isoelectric point (pI) of a protein is the pH at which the protein has no net charge. In this case, the pI of the monomeric form of protein A is 8. At pH 5, which is below the pI, the protein will have a net positive charge and will be positively charged. Therefore, the statement \"② pH 5에서 단백질은 양전하를 띤다.\" (At pH 5, the protein is positively charged.) is correct.\n\nNow, let's explain why the other options are incorrect:\n\n① The statement \"① 단량체는 4차 구조를 가진다.\" (The monomeric form has a quaternary structure.) is incorrect because quaternary structure refers to the arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains in a protein, and the monomeric form consists of a single polypeptide chain.\n\n③ The statement \"③ 80℃와 25℃에서의 3차 구조는 같다.\" (The tertiary structure at 80℃ and 25℃ is the same.) is incorrect because the melting temperature (60℃) indicates that the protein will lose its tertiary structure above this temperature. Therefore, the tertiary structure at 80℃ will be different from that at 25℃.\n\n④ The statement \"④ 2차 구조는 크기배제 액체크로마토그래프법으로 확인한다.\" (The secondary structure can be confirmed by size exclusion chromatography.) is incorrect because size exclusion chromatography is used to separate proteins based on their size, not to determine their secondary structure. Techniques such as circular dichroism or Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy are used to study secondary structures.\n\n⑤ The statement \"⑤ 단량체 수용액에 고농도의 sodium dodecyl sulfate를 가해도\" (Adding high concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate to the monomeric form solution) is incomplete and cannot be evaluated as a standalone statement. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is a detergent that can disrupt protein structure, but the statement does not specify the outcome or consequence of adding SDS to the monomeric form solution.<|im_end|>",
            "849": ": ④ 충전입자의 크기 감소\n\nExplanation: To improve the separation efficiency of the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method described in the question, reducing the particle size of the stationary phase (column packing material) is an effective approach. Smaller particles lead to an increased surface area, which allows for better separation of the compounds being analyzed. This is because it provides more interaction sites for the compounds, enabling better differentiation between them.\n\nThe other options are not as effective or are counterproductive:\n\n① Decreasing the column length would result in a shorter analysis time but would also decrease the separation efficiency, which is not desirable in this case.\n② Increasing the strength of the mobile phase (eluent) may affect the retention times of the compounds but does not necessarily improve the separation efficiency.\n③ Increasing the flow rate would also decrease the separation efficiency, as it would shorten the retention times and may lead to peak broadening or overlapping peaks.\n⑤ Decreasing the surface area of the stationary phase would be counterproductive, as it would reduce the interaction sites for the compounds and worsen the separation efficiency.<|im_end|>",

The clinical examination and laboratory results show that his blood pressure is still high (151/89 mmHg), but his electrolytes and renal function are within normal limits.\n\nThe appropriate choice for adding an additional antihypertensive medication would be an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), as the patient is already on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, losartan. Irbesartan is an ARB that can be added to the patient's regimen to help further control his blood pressure.\n\nDiltiazem (①) is a calcium channel blocker, hydralazine (②) is a direct vasodilator, furosemide (③) is a loop diuretic, and hydrochlorothiazide (⑤) is a thiazide-like diuretic. These medications can be used as antihypertensive agents, but in this case, an ARB would be the most appropriate addition to the patient's current medication regimen.<|im_end|>",
            "894": ": ② 프라수그렐(prasugrel)\n\nExplanation: In this case, the patient has been diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and is unable to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within the recommended time frame. Therefore, the treatment of choice is to administer thrombolytic therapy to dissolve the thrombus and restore blood flow to the myocardium. Aspirin is a standard medication for acute coronary syndrome, and it is important to administer an additional antiplatelet agent to enhance the anti-thrombotic effect.\n\nBetween the options provided, prasugrel (②) is the most appropriate choice for the additional antiplatelet agent. Prasugrel is a potent and selective P2Y12 receptor antagonist, which inhibits platelet aggregation and reduces the risk of recurrent coronary events. It has been shown to provide better clinical outcomes than clopidogrel (⑤) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, particularly in those with STEMI undergoing thrombolytic therapy.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for the following reasons:\n① Tirofiban is a platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, which is typically used for patients who are unable to undergo PCI or those with ongoing ischemic symptoms despite thrombolytic therapy. It is not the first choice for routine use in STEMI patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy.\n③ Cilostazol is an antiplatelet agent with phosphodiesterase inhibitor activity, which is generally used for the secondary prevention of stroke. It is not the first choice for acute coronary syndrome.\n④ Dipyridamole is an antiplatelet agent with vasodilatory properties, which is primarily used for the prevention of venous thromboembolism and has limited evidence for use in acute coronary syndrome.\n⑤ Clopidogrel is a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, but it has been shown to be less effective than prasugrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome, particularly in those with STEMI.<|im_end|>",

Recently, the hepatitis B virus DNA was detected at a level of 2,171 IU/mL, indicating a relapse or incomplete suppression of viral replication. The patient's ALT levels are normal, and resistance testing shows resistance to entecavir and lamivudine.\n\nIn cases of entecavir resistance in chronic hepatitis B, switching to a different class of antiviral medication is recommended. Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF) is a nucleotide analog with a high genetic barrier to resistance and has demonstrated superior efficacy in suppressing viral replication compared to entecavir. Therefore, switching the patient to tenofovir disoproxil is the most appropriate treatment option.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for the following reasons:\n① Ribavirin is primarily used for hepatitis C treatment and is not effective for hepatitis B.\n② Clevudine is an older nucleoside analog with a higher rate of resistance and is not recommended as a first-line therapy.\n③ Telbivudine is another nucleoside analog with a lower genetic barrier to resistance compared to tenofovir disoproxil.\n\nIn summary, the best option is to switch the patient to tenofovir disoproxil (TDF) to effectively suppress viral replication and manage the resistance issue.<|im_end|>",

Phentolamine (B) and Prazosin (C) are alpha-adrenergic antagonists, which means they block the action of epinephrine on alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to vasodilation and thus reducing the vasoconstrictor response.\n\n① Yohimbine (B) is an alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist, and timolol (C) is a beta-adrenergic antagonist. They do not antagonize the vasoconstrictor response to epinephrine.\n③ Phentolamine (B) is correct, but atropine (C) is a muscarinic antagonist and does not antagonize the vasoconstrictor response to epinephrine.\n④ Phenoxybenzamine (B) is a non-selective alpha-adrenergic antagonist, which is correct, but atropine (C) is not relevant as explained in ③.\n⑤ Phenoxybenzamine (B) is correct, but prazosin (C) has already been mentioned in the correct answer ②.<|im_end|>",

Methanol is metabolized in the liver to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which causes metabolic acidosis and can lead to severe toxicity. The treatment for methanol poisoning includes administration of fomepizole, which is an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase and thus slows down the metabolism of methanol to formaldehyde. Hemodialysis can also be used to remove methanol, formic acid, and formaldehyde from the blood. Atropine can be used for the treatment of organophosphorus poisoning, and pralidoxime is used for the treatment of carbamate and organophosphorus poisoning. Amyl nitrite is used in the treatment of cyanide poisoning. There is no specific treatment for methanol poisoning other than supportive care, which makes option ④ incorrect.<|im_end|>",

When the wavelength of light matches the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state of the outermost electrons, these electrons can be excited to a higher energy level, resulting in the absorption of light. This phenomenon is specific to the electronic transitions in molecules and is the principle behind UV-Vis spectroscopy.\n\n① 전자의 핵스핀 (Nuclear spin of electrons) is not related to the absorption of light in UV-Vis spectroscopy.\n② 분자의 진동 운동 (Molecular vibration) is related to the absorption of infrared light, not UV-Vis light.\n③ 분자의 회전 운동 (Molecular rotation) is related to the absorption of microwave radiation, not UV-Vis light.\n④ 원자의 내부전자 전이 (Inner electron transition of atoms) is not relevant to the absorption of UV-Vis light, as it involves the transition of electrons within the inner shells of atoms, which does not typically occur in the UV-Vis range.<|im_end|>",

The most appropriate action would be to add a phosphate binder such as sevelamer to help reduce phosphate absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Increasing the calcium carbonate dose (option ①) may further exacerbate the hypercalcemia. Adding calcium polystyrene sulfonate (option ③) is not the best choice because it is typically used for potassium exchange rather than for phosphate control. Changing the calcium carbonate to sevelamer (option ④) would not address the existing hyperphosphatemia. Changing the calcium carbonate to calcium polystyrene sulfonate (option ⑤) would not be appropriate, as both are less effective for phosphate control compared to sevelamer.<|im_end|>",

The patient's IgE level is elevated, and skin prick testing is positive for house dust mite, indicating an allergic component to their asthma. Given the patient's history of poor control with current treatment and allergen sensitization, adding an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, such as omalizumab, would be an appropriate next step to help manage the patient's asthma.\n\nThe other options are not as suitable for this patient:\n① Reslizumab is another monoclonal antibody used for severe asthma, but it targets the IL-5 cytokine, which is not directly related to IgE-mediated allergic asthma.\n③ and ④ Discontinuing fluticasone/salmeterol and switching to reslizumab or omalizumab without continuing an inhaled corticosteroid would not be appropriate, as it would leave the patient without adequate control of their asthma inflammation.\n⑤ Adding tiotropium to the existing treatment without addressing the allergen-induced component of the patient's asthma would not be the most appropriate next step.<|im_end|>",

The question asks for an appropriate beta-blocker to add to the treatment when the blood pressure is not well controlled. Carteolol (카르테올롤) is a beta-blocker that can be used for both glaucoma and COPD, making it the most appropriate choice in this situation. The other options are not suitable for various reasons:\n\n① Timolol (티몰롤) is a non-selective beta-blocker, which may not be the best choice for COPD patients.\n② Betaxolol (베탁솔롤) is a selective beta-1 blocker, which may not effectively lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients.\n④ Nipradilol (니프라딜롤) is not commonly used for COPD treatment.\n⑤ Levobunolol (레보부놀롤) is a beta-blocker for glaucoma, but it is not specifically indicated for COPD.<|im_end|>",
