When atropine is administered, it causes dilation of the pupil (mydriasis) and a decrease in the production of aqueous humor, leading to a reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP). Therefore, the correct answer is option ②, which states that atropine causes a decrease in IOP due to an increase in the outflow of aqueous humor.\n\nOption ① is incorrect because atropine actually decreases the production of aqueous humor, not its outflow. Option ③ is incorrect because atropine affects the iris sphincter, causing dilation of the pupil, not constriction. Option ④ is also incorrect because atropine causes relaxation of the iris sphincter, not constriction. Finally, option ⑤ is incorrect because atropine does not directly affect the ciliary muscle; its primary action is on the iris sphincter and the production of aqueous humor.<|im_end|>"

The clinical examination results show low potassium levels (K 3.0 mEq/L), which can lead to digitalis toxicity (in this case, digoxin toxicity) when combined with furosemide. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that can cause potassium loss, leading to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can increase the risk of digitalis toxicity, which can cause bradycardia, heart block, and ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's bradycardia is furosemide-induced hypokalemia, leading to digoxin toxicity.<|im_end|>"

The current medications include aspirin for cardiovascular protection, ramipril for hypertension, metoprolol for angina, metformin for diabetes, and nitroglycerin for angina. The patient's lipid panel shows an elevated total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.\n\nGiven the patient's lipid profile, it would be appropriate to add a medication to help manage his elevated TC and LDL-C levels. Among the options provided, ezetimibe (③) is a cholesterol-lowering drug that works by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine. This would help reduce the patient's TC and LDL-C levels, thus decreasing his risk of cardiovascular events.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for the patient's condition:\n① Apixaban is an anticoagulant and is not indicated for managing lipid levels.\n② Doxazosin is an alpha-blocker and is not indicated for managing lipid levels.\n④ Atorvastatin is a statin that can also lower cholesterol, but ezetimibe is the better choice here because the patient is already on a beta-blocker (metoprolol) for angina, and adding a statin would not provide additional benefit for the management of elevated LDL-C levels.\n⑤ Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic used for managing hypertension, but it is not indicated for managing lipid levels.<|im_end|>"

Hydrocortisone 1% cream is a suitable option for mild to moderate cases of atopic dermatitis.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for this case:\n① Mupirocin is an antibiotic used for skin infections, not for atopic dermatitis.\n② Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressive agent used for severe atopic dermatitis cases, but it is not the first-line treatment for mild to moderate cases.\n④ Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent used for more severe cases of atopic dermatitis and is not a topical treatment.\n⑤ Methylprednisolone is an oral corticosteroid, which is not the preferred treatment for atopic dermatitis, as topical corticosteroids are more effective and have fewer systemic side effects.<|im_end|>"

Among the options, minocycline is the medication that needs further assessment because it is an antibiotic of the tetracycline class, which is contraindicated in children under 8 years of age due to the risk of dental staining. Therefore, the pharmacist should consult with the prescriber to confirm the appropriateness of the prescription.\n\nThe other options are not selected for the following reasons:\n① 정장제 캡슐 (Probiotic capsule): Probiotics are generally considered safe and are not a concern for DUR consultation.\n② 세티리진 정 (Cetirizine tablet): Cetirizine is a common antihistamine and does not require DUR consultation unless there are specific concerns or interactions.\n④ 아세트아미노펜 정 (Acetaminophen tablet): Acetaminophen is a common pain reliever and fever reducer, and the dose prescribed is within the recommended limits for children.\n⑤ 피메크로리무스 크림 (Pimecrolimus cream): Topical medications like pimecrolimus cream for skin conditions typically do not require DUR consultation unless there are specific concerns or interactions.<|im_end|>"

The process involves several steps, and Dicer is involved in step B, which is the processing of the pre-miRNA into a double-stranded miRNA duplex. This step occurs after the hairpin-shaped pre-miRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where Dicer cleaves the hairpin loop, generating the mature miRNA and its complementary strand. The other options (A, C, D, and E) represent different stages in the miRNA biogenesis pathway, but they are not the specific step where Dicer acts.<|im_end|>"

Therefore, for a 100 mL solution, we need 1 gram of dextran.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much fructose is needed to achieve the desired concentration of sodium nitrate. The ratio of sodium nitrate from dextran is:\n\n(0.2 g/mol dextran) / (0.16 g/mol fructose) = 1.25\n\nThis means that for every 1.25 g of dextran, we need 1 g of fructose to maintain the same concentration of sodium nitrate as in blood.\n\nSince we need 1 g of dextran for the 1% solution, we can now calculate the amount of fructose needed:\n\n1 g dextran * (1 g fructose / 1.25 g dextran) = 0.8 g fructose\n\nHowever, we need to round to the second decimal place, so the answer is 2.2 g fructose.<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ⑤ 300\n\nExplanation: According to the Noyes-Whitney equation, the dissolution rate (R) of a drug is proportional to the surface area (A) of the drug particle. The surface area is inversely proportional to the diameter (D) of the particle. Therefore, if the diameter of the drug particle is reduced to 0.2 mm (1/10 of the original diameter), the surface area will increase by 100 times.\n\nSince the dissolution rate is directly proportional to the surface area, the dissolution rate will also increase by 100 times under the same conditions. In the original case, 3 mg of aspipro was dissolved in 1 minute. Therefore, with the increased dissolution rate, 3 mg x 100 = 300 mg of aspipro is expected to be dissolved in 1 minute.<|im_end|>"

In this case, aspirin (a weak acid) would be more absorbed in the stomach (where the pH is low) than in the small intestine (where the pH is higher). This is because at low pH, aspirin remains in its non-ionized form, which is more lipophilic and can easily cross the lipid membrane of the stomach lining. In contrast, in the small intestine, the higher pH causes aspirin to ionize, reducing its lipophilicity and absorption. The other theories listed are not directly related to the absorption of weak acids and bases in the gastrointestinal tract.<|im_end|>"

We know that 5 mL of the solution was diluted to 50 mL, so the concentration of the diluted solution is:\n\n(10.0 mg / 100 mL) × (5 mL / 50 mL) = 0.1 mg/mL\n\nNow, we can rearrange the Beer-Lambert Law to solve for ε:\n\nε = A / (c × l)\n\nWe are given the absorbance (A) and the path length (l = 1 cm), and we have calculated the molar concentration (c = 0.1 mg/mL). Plugging these values into the equation, we get:\n\nε = A / (0.1 M × 1 cm)\n\nε = A / M\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ④ A/M.<|im_end|>"

This indicates that the aspirin has degraded, most likely through hydrolysis, which is a common degradation pathway for esters under such conditions.\n\nHydrolysis of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) produces salicylic acid and acetic acid. The chromatographic analysis detected two peaks at 5.0 min and 10.0 min, which correspond to the degradation products salicylic acid and acetic acid, respectively. The retention times (tR) of these peaks can be used to identify the compounds, with the earlier eluting peak (5.0 min) being salicylic acid and the later eluting peak (10.0 min) being acetic acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ③ hydrolysis | aspirin | salicylic acid.<|im_end|>"

His clinical laboratory findings show increased total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels, with slightly decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The primary goal is to manage hyperlipidemia, particularly reducing TC and TG levels.\n\nOption ① 에제티미브(ezetimibe) is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that reduces the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine, leading to a decrease in LDL-C and TC levels. It is often used as an add-on therapy when the target LDL-C levels are not achieved with statin therapy alone.\n\nOption ② 겜피브로질(gemfibrozil) and option ④ 페노피브레이트(fenofibrate) are fibrate drugs that primarily reduce triglyceride levels and slightly increase HDL-C levels. However, these drugs may not be the most appropriate choice in this case, as the patient is already on a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) for diabetes management, and fibrates may have potential interactions with other lipid-lowering agents.\n\nOption ③ 플루바스타틴(fluvastatin) is a statin drug that primarily lowers LDL-C levels. The patient is already on atorvastatin, another statin drug, so adding another statin would not be appropriate.\n\nOption ⑤ 콜레스티라민(cholestyramine) is a bile acid resin that can be used to lower LDL-C levels, but it is less commonly used and may cause gastrointestinal side effects.\n\nConsidering the patient's current medications and laboratory findings, option ① 에제티미브(ezetimibe) is the most appropriate choice for an additional medication to help manage the patient's hyperlipidemia.<|im_end|>"

Adding a corticosteroid to her treatment regimen will help to control her asthma more effectively and reduce her symptoms.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for this patient:\n\n① 테오필린(theophylline) 경구제: Theophylline is a bronchodilator that can help to relieve asthma symptoms, but it is not typically used as an additional medication when a patient is already using a short-acting bronchodilator like salbutamol.\n\n② 티오트로퓸(tiotropium) 흡입제: Tiotropium is an inhaled anticholinergic medication used for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), not asthma.\n\n④ 오말리주맙(omalizumab) 주사제: Omalizumab is an injectable medication used for patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma who have allergies to certain substances, such as pollen or dust mites. This patient does not have severe, uncontrolled asthma, and there is no mention of allergies, so omalizumab is not appropriate.\n\n⑤ 메틸프레드니솔론(methylprednisolone) 경구제: Methylprednisolone is an oral corticosteroid that can be used for short-term treatment of severe asthma exacerbations, but it is not typically used as a long-term addition to asthma treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids like budesonide are preferred for ongoing management.<|im_end|>"

The current medication includes hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, which is appropriate for initial management. However, the patient's blood pressure is still not well-controlled (>130/80 mmHg), and the presence of proteinuria (ACR 240 mg/g) indicates a need for better blood pressure control.\n\nRamipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is the most suitable choice for this patient because it has been shown to reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of CKD, in addition to its antihypertensive effects. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the preferred first-line agents for patients with CKD.\n\nThe other options are not as appropriate:\n\n③ Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker, which can be used as an additional agent if the blood pressure is still not well-controlled, but it does not have the renoprotective effects that ramipril provides.\n\n④ Carvedilol is a beta-blocker, which may be considered in some cases, but it is not the first choice for patients with CKD due to its limited renoprotective effects.\n\n⑤ Increasing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide may be considered, but it is generally less effective than adding a renoprotective agent like ramipril.\n\n① Continuing the current medication without addition is not suitable, as the patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled, and there is proteinuria present.<|im_end|>"

In this case, the patient is experiencing dystonia as a side effect of haloperidol treatment. Benztropine can help alleviate the symptoms of dystonia by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in muscle contraction. The other options listed are not primarily used for the treatment of dystonia:\n\n① Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).\n② Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders.\n③ Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist used to treat nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal motility disorders.\n⑤ Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist and prokinetic agent used to treat gastrointestinal motility disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and delayed gastric emptying.<|im_end|>"

However, it can cause side effects such as constipation, which can be a particular concern for patients who are already immobile or have reduced gastrointestinal motility, such as those who have undergone surgery.\n\nOpioid-induced constipation can be managed with various medications, including laxatives, stool softeners, and prokinetic agents. However, in this case, the most appropriate option is octreotide, a somatostatin analog administered as an injection. Octreotide works by inhibiting the release of gastrointestinal hormones that stimulate the production of fluid in the intestines, thereby reducing constipation. It is often used in patients with opioid-induced constipation that does not respond to other treatments.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for this specific situation:\n① Mesalazine is used for treating inflammatory bowel disease, not for managing morphine-induced constipation.\n③ Psyllium is a bulk-forming laxative, which can be used for constipation but is less effective in cases of opioid-induced constipation.\n④ Bisacodyl is a stimulant laxative and can be used for acute constipation, but it is not the first choice for managing chronic opioid-induced constipation.\n⑤ Dioctahedral smectite is a clay-based agent used for its adsorbent properties, not for treating constipation.<|im_end|>"

        "answer": 3,
        "response": ": ①\n\nExplanation: The process capability index (CPI) is a measure of the ability of a process to meet specifications. It is calculated by comparing the process mean and the process variability to the upper and lower specification limits. In this case, the process mean is 100.0 mg, and the process variability (standard deviation) is ±2.0 mg. The specification limits are 95.0 mg (lower) and 105.0 mg (upper).\n\nTo calculate the CPI, we use the following formula:\n\nCPI = (USL - LSL) / (6 * σ)\n\nwhere USL is the upper specification limit, LSL is the lower specification limit, and σ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case:\n\nCPI = (105.0 - 95.0) / (6 * 2.0) = 10 / 12 ≈ 0.83\n\nA CPI of 1.0 or greater indicates that the process is capable of meeting the specifications. A CPI between 0.67 and 1.0 indicates that the process is marginally capable. In this case, the CPI is approximately 0.83, which is close to 1.0, indicating that the process is capable of meeting the specifications.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ①, which states that the status is very satisfactory and the current state should be maintained. The other options indicate that there are issues with the process capability, which is not the case here.<|im_end|>"

These IgG antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the fetal red blood cells, leading to hemolysis and erythroblastosis fetalis.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n① 모체의 탐식세포 활성화 (Activation of the mother's phagocytes) is not the direct cause of erythroblastosis fetalis.\n② 출산 시 모체로 유입된 태아의 적혈구 (Fetal red blood cells entering the mother at birth) would not cause erythroblastosis fetalis in a subsequent pregnancy.\n③ 모체의 T 세포에 의한 지연형 과민반응 (Delayed type hypersensitivity reaction by the mother's T cells) is not related to erythroblastosis fetalis.\n④ 모체에서 생성된 Rh 항원에 대한 IgM 항체 (IgM antibodies against Rh antigens produced by the mother) would not cross the placenta and would not cause erythroblastosis fetalis.<|im_end|>"

This complex is involved in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) in the mitochondria. Deficiencies in this enzyme can lead to branched-chain aminoacidemia and, in severe cases, to a disorder called branched-chain ketoaciduria or Maple Syrup Urine Disease.

        "answer": 2,
        "response": ": ②\n\nExplanation: The isoelectric point (pI) of a protein is the pH at which the protein has no net charge. In this case, the pI of the monomeric form of protein A is 8. At pH 5, which is below the pI, the protein will have a net positive charge and will be positively charged. Therefore, the statement \"② pH 5에서 단백질은 양전하를 띤다.\" (At pH 5, the protein is positively charged.) is correct.\n\nNow, let's explain why the other options are incorrect:\n\n① The statement \"① 단량체는 4차 구조를 가진다.\" (The monomeric form has a quaternary structure.) is incorrect because quaternary structure refers to the arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains in a protein, and the monomeric form consists of a single polypeptide chain.\n\n③ The statement \"③ 80℃와 25℃에서의 3차 구조는 같다.\" (The tertiary structure at 80℃ and 25℃ is the same.) is incorrect because the melting temperature (60℃) indicates that the protein will lose its tertiary structure above this temperature. Therefore, the tertiary structure at 80℃ will be different from that at 25℃.\n\n④ The statement \"④ 2차 구조는 크기배제 액체크로마토그래프법으로 확인한다.\" (The secondary structure can be confirmed by size exclusion chromatography.) is incorrect because size exclusion chromatography is used to separate proteins based on their size, not to determine their secondary structure. Techniques such as circular dichroism or Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy are used to study secondary structures.\n\n⑤ The statement \"⑤ 단량체 수용액에 고농도의 sodium dodecyl sulfate를 가해도\" (Adding high concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate to the monomeric form solution) is incomplete and cannot be evaluated as a standalone statement. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is a detergent that can disrupt protein structure, but the statement does not specify the outcome or consequence of adding SDS to the monomeric form solution.<|im_end|>"

Smaller particles lead to an increased surface area, which allows for better separation of the compounds being analyzed. This is because it provides more interaction sites for the compounds, enabling better differentiation between them.\n\nThe other options are not as effective or are counterproductive:\n\n① Decreasing the column length would result in a shorter analysis time but would also decrease the separation efficiency, which is not desirable in this case.\n② Increasing the strength of the mobile phase (eluent) may affect the retention times of the compounds but does not necessarily improve the separation efficiency.\n③ Increasing the flow rate would also decrease the separation efficiency, as it would shorten the retention times and may lead to peak broadening or overlapping peaks.\n⑤ Decreasing the surface area of the stationary phase would be counterproductive, as it would reduce the interaction sites for the compounds and worsen the separation efficiency.<|im_end|>"

The mobile phase is a mixture of water and methanol with a pH adjusted to 4.5, and the stationary phase is a C18 reversed-phase column. The aspirin molecule will interact with the stationary phase due to its acidic nature (pKa = 3.5) and will be retained on the column. The separation occurs based on the distribution of the aspirin molecule between the stationary and mobile phases, which is governed by the partitioning mechanism.

        "response": ": ① pH를 5.5로 조정한다.\n\nExplanation: The question asks for a way to increase the retention time of aspirin in the chromatography column. The retention time of a compound in chromatography is influenced by the pH of the mobile phase, as it affects the ionization state of the compound. Aspirin has a pKa of 3.5, meaning it will predominantly exist in its ionized form (aspirin-) at pH values above 3.5 and in its non-ionized form (aspirin) at pH values below 3.5.\n\nThe current mobile phase has a pH of 4.5, which is close to aspirin's pKa. This results in a balance between the ionized and non-ionized forms of aspirin, leading to a certain retention time. To increase the retention time, we need to shift the equilibrium towards the non-ionized form (aspirin), which will have stronger interactions with the stationary phase.\n\nBy increasing the pH to 5.5 (option ①), we will further shift the equilibrium towards the non-ionized form of aspirin, leading to an increase in retention time. Lowering the pH to 3.0 (option ②) will not significantly increase the retention time, as it is already close to aspirin's pKa. Changing the composition of the mobile phase (options ③, ④, and ⑤) will have a lesser effect on the retention time compared to adjusting the pH.<|im_end|>"

Therefore, the treatment of choice is to administer thrombolytic therapy to dissolve the thrombus and restore blood flow to the myocardium. Aspirin is a standard medication for acute coronary syndrome, and it is important to administer an additional antiplatelet agent to enhance the anti-thrombotic effect.\n\nBetween the options provided, prasugrel (②) is the most appropriate choice for the additional antiplatelet agent. Prasugrel is a potent and selective P2Y12 receptor antagonist, which inhibits platelet aggregation and reduces the risk of recurrent coronary events. It has been shown to provide better clinical outcomes than clopidogrel (⑤) in patients with acute coronary syndrome, particularly in those with STEMI undergoing thrombolytic therapy.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for the following reasons:\n① Tirofiban is a platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, which is typically used for patients who are unable to undergo PCI or those with ongoing ischemic symptoms despite thrombolytic therapy. It is not the first choice for routine use in STEMI patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy.\n③ Cilostazol is an antiplatelet agent with phosphodiesterase inhibitor activity, which is generally used for the secondary prevention of stroke. It is not the first choice for acute coronary syndrome.\n④ Dipyridamole is an antiplatelet agent with vasodilatory properties, which is primarily used for the prevention of venous thromboembolism and has limited evidence for use in acute coronary syndrome.\n⑤ Clopidogrel is a P2Y12 receptor antagonist, but it has been shown to be less effective than prasugrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome, particularly in those with STEMI.<|im_end|>"

In this case, the addition of an antiplatelet agent is indicated to prevent further ischemic events. Among the options provided, ticagrelor is a potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor that is commonly used in the management of NSTE-ACS patients, especially those who are high-risk or undergoing invasive procedures. Ticagrelor provides faster and more potent inhibition of platelet aggregation compared to clopidogrel, which makes it a preferred choice in this situation. The other options, abciximab, prasugrel, dipyridamole, and clopidogrel, may also be used for antiplatelet therapy in NSTE-ACS, but ticagrelor is the most appropriate choice given its rapid onset and strong antiplatelet effect.<|im_end|>"

Recently, the hepatitis B virus DNA was detected at a level of 2,171 IU/mL, indicating a relapse or incomplete suppression of viral replication. The patient's ALT levels are normal, and resistance testing shows resistance to entecavir and lamivudine.\n\nIn cases of entecavir resistance in chronic hepatitis B, switching to a different class of antiviral medication is recommended. Tenofovir disoproxil (TDF) is a nucleotide analog with a high genetic barrier to resistance and has demonstrated superior efficacy in suppressing viral replication compared to entecavir. Therefore, switching the patient to tenofovir disoproxil is the most appropriate treatment option.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for the following reasons:\n① Ribavirin is primarily used for hepatitis C treatment and is not effective for hepatitis B.\n② Clevudine is an older nucleoside analog with a higher rate of resistance and is not recommended as a first-line therapy.\n③ Telbivudine is another nucleoside analog with a lower genetic barrier to resistance compared to tenofovir disoproxil.\n\nIn summary, the best option is to switch the patient to tenofovir disoproxil (TDF) to effectively suppress viral replication and manage the resistance issue.<|im_end|>"

In such cases, adding a NMDA receptor antagonist like memantine can provide additional benefit by reducing neuroexcitotoxicity and improving cognitive function. Therefore, option ② is the most appropriate choice.\n\nOptions ①, ④, and ⑤ involve changing or adjusting the cholinesterase inhibitor, which may not significantly improve the patient's condition. Option ③, ginkgo leaf, is a dietary supplement with limited evidence for its effectiveness in treating Alzheimer's disease, making it an unsuitable choice for this patient.<|im_end|>"

Nasal decongestants can cause a rebound effect, leading to worsening congestion if used for more than a few days.

Drugs that are effective in Alzheimer's disease primarily work by enhancing cholinergic activity. Rivastigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which means it works by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing for an increase in acetylcholine levels in the synaptic cleft and prolonging its action. This makes option ⑤ the correct answer.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n① 갈란타민(galantamine) - Although galantamine also acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, it is not the most commonly prescribed drug for Alzheimer's disease.\n② 프라미펙솔(pramipexole) - This is a dopamine agonist used primarily for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and not Alzheimer's disease.\n③ 베사미콜(vesamicol) - This drug inhibits the uptake of acetylcholine into vesicles, but it does not directly increase the levels of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft.\n④ 헤미콜리늄(hemicholinium) - This drug inhibits the uptake of choline, an essential precursor for acetylcholine synthesis, but it does not directly target the enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine.<|im_end|>"

Phentolamine (B) and Prazosin (C) are alpha-adrenergic antagonists, which means they block the action of epinephrine on alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to vasodilation and thus reducing the vasoconstrictor response.\n\n① Yohimbine (B) is an alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist, and timolol (C) is a beta-adrenergic antagonist. They do not antagonize the vasoconstrictor response to epinephrine.\n③ Phentolamine (B) is correct, but atropine (C) is a muscarinic antagonist and does not antagonize the vasoconstrictor response to epinephrine.\n④ Phenoxybenzamine (B) is a non-selective alpha-adrenergic antagonist, which is correct, but atropine (C) is not relevant as explained in ③.\n⑤ Phenoxybenzamine (B) is correct, but prazosin (C) has already been mentioned in the correct answer ②.<|im_end|>"

The treatment for methanol poisoning includes administration of fomepizole, which is an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase and thus slows down the metabolism of methanol to formaldehyde. Hemodialysis can also be used to remove methanol, formic acid, and formaldehyde from the blood. Atropine can be used for the treatment of organophosphorus poisoning, and pralidoxime is used for the treatment of carbamate and organophosphorus poisoning.

        "response": ": ① 고체상 A, 액체상 B\n\nExplanation:\nThe question describes a two-component phase diagram at 1 atm pressure, including solid and liquid states. The melting points of substances A and B are given as 68°C and 40°C, respectively, and their congruent point is 20°C. We are asked to determine the state of the mixture containing 85% A and 15% B at 25°C.\n\nAt 25°C, both substances A and B are in the liquid state because their melting points are higher than 25°C. Since substance A has a higher melting point than substance B, it will be in the solid state at the congruent point (20°C), while substance B will be in the liquid state at the same temperature. As the temperature increases above the congruent point, both substances will be in the liquid state.\n\nTherefore, at 25°C, the mixture of A and B will have substance A in the solid state and substance B in the liquid state. The correct answer is ① 고체상 A, 액체상 B.<|im_end|>"

When the wavelength of light matches the energy gap between the ground state and the excited state of the outermost electrons, these electrons can be excited to a higher energy level, resulting in the absorption of light. This phenomenon is specific to the electronic transitions in molecules and is the principle behind UV-Vis spectroscopy.\n\n① 전자의 핵스핀 (Nuclear spin of electrons) is not related to the absorption of light in UV-Vis spectroscopy.\n② 분자의 진동 운동 (Molecular vibration) is related to the absorption of infrared light, not UV-Vis light.\n③ 분자의 회전 운동 (Molecular rotation) is related to the absorption of microwave radiation, not UV-Vis light.\n④ 원자의 내부전자 전이 (Inner electron transition of atoms) is not relevant to the absorption of UV-Vis light, as it involves the transition of electrons within the inner shells of atoms, which does not typically occur in the UV-Vis range.<|im_end|>"

The patient has a history of hypertension, angina, and a heart attack, and is currently taking medications for these conditions. The question asks for an additional medication to control angina.\n\nOption ⑤ 이소소르비드질산염(isosorbide dinitrate) is a medication that can be used to prevent and relieve angina. It works by relaxing blood vessels and improving blood flow to the heart. This medication can be used in addition to the patient's current medications to help control angina symptoms.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for the following reasons:\n\n① 펠로디핀(felodipine) is a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure and angina, but it is not the best choice for this patient because it can cause reflex tachycardia (increased heart rate) which may worsen the patient's angina.\n\n② 리시노프릴(lisinopril) is an ACE inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, but it is not effective in controlling angina.\n\n③ 메토프롤롤(metoprolol) is a beta-blocker used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and heart failure. However, it can also cause decreased heart rate and reduced blood pressure, which may not be suitable for a patient with angina who needs to improve blood flow to the heart.\n\n④ 베라파밀(verapamil) is a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and other heart conditions. However, it can cause bradycardia (slow heart rate) and decreased blood pressure, which may not be suitable for a patient with angina who needs to improve blood flow to the heart.<|im_end|>"

However, the symptoms are not well controlled.\n\nOption 1 (티오트로퓴 흡입제 추가) is the correct answer because tiotropium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) that can be added to the patient's regimen to improve symptom control. LAMAs work by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways, which helps to open the airways and improve breathing.\n\nOption 2 (살부타몰 흡입제 매일 사용으로 변경) is incorrect because increasing the frequency of the short-acting beta-agonist (salbutamol) without adding a long-acting bronchodilator may not effectively control the patient's symptoms.\n\nOption 3 (살부타몰 흡입제 중단 후 툴로부테롤 패치 추가) is incorrect because discontinuing the short-acting beta-agonist and adding a long-acting beta-agonist (tulobuterol patch) without a long-acting muscarinic antagonist may not provide optimal symptom control.\n\nOption 4 (저용량 부데소니드 흡입제 중단 후 포르모테롤/아클리디늄 흡입제 추가) is incorrect because discontinuing the inhaled corticosteroid without adding a long-acting muscarinic antagonist may not provide optimal symptom control.\n\nOption 5 (사용약물 중단 후 저용량 부데소니드/포르모테롤 흡입제로 변경) is incorrect because discontinuing all medications and switching to a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta-agonist combination without a long-acting muscarinic antagonist may not provide optimal symptom control.<|im_end|>"

The initial pharmacological management for COPD includes short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) for symptom relief and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for patients with frequent exacerbations or moderate to severe airflow limitation.

Increasing the calcium carbonate dose (option ①) may further exacerbate the hypercalcemia. Adding calcium polystyrene sulfonate (option ③) is not the best choice because it is typically used for potassium exchange rather than for phosphate control. Changing the calcium carbonate to sevelamer (option ④) would not address the existing hyperphosphatemia.

Empagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that lowers blood sugar levels by promoting glucose excretion through the kidneys.

        "response": ": ③\n\nExplanation: To calculate the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), we need to find the expected number of deaths due to colon cancer in the population of A region and compare it to the observed number of deaths.\n\nExpected deaths for each age group can be calculated by multiplying the population of A region in that age group by the standard mortality rate for that age group.\n\nExpected deaths (20-39): 500,000 * (2/100,000) = 100\nExpected deaths (40-59): 800,000 * (4/100,000) = 320\nExpected deaths (60+): 900,000 * (12/100,000) = 1,080\n\nTotal expected deaths = 100 + 320 + 1,080 = 1,500\n\nNow, we can calculate the SMR:\n\nSMR = (Observed deaths / Expected deaths) = (300 / 1,500) = 0.2\n\nSince the SMR is less than 1 (0.2 < 1), it indicates that the risk of colon cancer in the population of A region is lower than that of the standard population. However, the question asks for the correct statement regarding the standardized mortality ratio, and option ③ states that the value is greater than 1, which is incorrect. But given the available options, the closest correct statement is:\n\n③ The value is greater than 1, so the risk of colon cancer in A region is higher than that of the standard population.\n\nThis option is not entirely accurate in terms of the actual SMR calculation, but it is the best choice among the given options.<|im_end|>"

However, the apparent Vmax (the maximum reaction rate) will decrease because the inhibitor reduces the maximum achievable reaction rate by preventing the enzyme from reaching its full activity. Therefore, the correct answer is a change in Km is none (⑤ 변화 없음) and Vmax decreases (감소).<|im_end|>"

This type of receptor is known as a ligand-gated ion channel. Among the options, GABA\\_A receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that are involved in the inhibition of neuronal activity in the central nervous system. When GABA binds to the GABA\\_A receptor, it causes the opening of an ion channel, leading to the influx of chloride ions into the cell, which hyperpolarizes the cell membrane and makes it less likely for the neuron to fire an action potential. This process is essential for the regulation of neuronal activity and the maintenance of brain homeostasis.<|im_end|>"

In this case, the capping is occurring during the compression of the granules to form the final tablet. To improve this issue, an excipient that can help to reduce the adhesion can be added. Crosscarmellose sodium is a highly crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt that is used as a disintegrant and binder in tablet formulations. Adding more crosscarmellose sodium can help to improve the flow properties and reduce the capping effect during tablet compression. Therefore, the correct pairing to improve the capping issue is with crosscarmellose sodium.<|im_end|>"

His blood glucose levels are still elevated (fasting blood glucose 154 mg/dL), and he has other comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity. A dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor like saxagliptin can be added to his treatment regimen. DPP-4 inhibitors help control blood glucose levels by increasing the levels of incretins, which stimulate insulin release from the pancreas and suppress glucagon secretion.

The normal platelet count range is 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. The patient's platelet count is 3,100/mm3, which is significantly lower than the normal range.\n\nThe first step in managing this side effect is to temporarily discontinue imatinib (Answer ①). This allows the platelet count to recover, and if the side effect is reversible, the platelet count should return to a safer level after a short break from the medication.\n\nThe other options are not appropriate for this situation:\n\n② Dexamethasone is typically used for the treatment of specific conditions such as multiple myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma, not for managing side effects of imatinib.\n\n③ Hydroxyurea is another medication used in the treatment of CML, but it is not the appropriate action in this case because the patient is responding well to imatinib, as indicated by the lack of Bcr-abl gene mutation. Switching medications without a reason related to the effectiveness of the treatment is not recommended.\n\n④ Darbepoetin alfa is an erythropoietin receptor agonist used to treat anemia, not to manage side effects of imatinib.\n\n⑤ Ponatinib is another tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of CML, but it is reserved for patients who have developed resistance or intolerance to imatinib. Since the patient does not have a reason to switch medications based on the information provided, this option is not appropriate.<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ⑤ 131℃에서 0.4분간 멸균\n\nExplanation: To determine the correct answer, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of thermal sterilization.\n\nGiven:\n- D121 = 1.0 min\n- Z value = 10°C\n- Initial bioburden = 10^3\n- AUC = 8.0 min\n\nFirst, we need to find the F0 value, which is the equivalent sterilization time at 121°C. The formula to calculate F0 is:\n\nF0 = D121 * AUC\n\nF0 = 1.0 min * 8.0 min = 8 min\n\nNow, we need to find the sterilization condition that is equivalent to an F0 value of 8 min using the Z value. The relationship between temperature and F value is given by:\n\nF(T) = F0 * 10^((T - 121) / Z)\n\nWe need to solve for T when F(T) = F0 = 8 min:\n\n8 = 8 * 10^((T - 121) / 10)\n\n1 = 10^((T - 121) / 10)\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides:\n\nlog(1) = log(10^((T - 121) / 10))\n\n0 = (T - 121) / 10\n\nT - 121 = 0\n\nT = 121°C\n\nHowever, this is the temperature at which the F0 value is 8 min, and we need to find a condition that is equivalent to this sterilization effect. Since the Z value is 10°C, we can increase the temperature by 10°C to find an equivalent condition:\n\nT = 121°C + 10°C = 131°C\n\nNow, we need to find the time required at this temperature to achieve the same sterilization effect (F0 = 8 min). We can use the formula:\n\nF0 = D(T) * t\n\nWhere D(T) is the D value at temperature T, and t is the time required. We can rearrange the formula to solve for t:\n\nt = F0 / D(T)\n\nWe know that D121 = 1.0 min, and since the temperature increased by 10°C (Z value), we can assume that the D value at 131°C will be approximately the same:\n\nD(131) ≈ D121 = 1.0 min\n\nNow, we can calculate the time required:\n\nt = 8 min / 1.0 min = 8 min\n\nHowever, we need to convert this time to a decimal value to match the options given in the question:\n\nt = 8 min / 10 * 1/10 = 0.8 min\n\nThe closest option to this value is:\n\n⑤ 131℃에서 0.4분간 멸균\n\nNote that the actual calculation of D(131) would require more complex calculations involving the Arrhenius equation, but for the purpose of this exam, we can assume that the D value remains approximately the same as D121 due to the small change in temperature (10°C).<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ② 50병\n\nExplanation:\nTo determine the reorder point, we need to consider the daily demand, lead time, and safety stock.\n\n1. Calculate the daily demand:\nAnnual demand = 7,300 bottles\nNumber of days in a year = 365 days\nDaily demand = Annual demand / Number of days in a year\nDaily demand = 7,300 / 365 ≈ 20 bottles per day\n\n2. Determine the reorder point without safety stock:\nLead time = 5 days\nReorder point (without safety stock) = Daily demand * Lead time\nReorder point (without safety stock) = 20 * 5 = 100 bottles\n\n3. Calculate the reorder point with safety stock:\nSafety stock = 146 bottles\nReorder point (with safety stock) = Reorder point (without safety stock) + Safety stock\nReorder point (with safety stock) = 100 + 146 = 246 bottles\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the minimum inventory level at which to reorder to avoid stockout risk, we should consider the reorder point without safety stock as the base. In this case, the reorder point is 100 bottles. To account for any potential fluctuations in demand or lead time, we should add a safety margin to the reorder point.\n\n4. Add a safety margin to the reorder point:\nConsidering the lead time demand and the safety stock, we can add a safety margin of 50 bottles (half of the safety stock) to the reorder point to ensure that the risk of stockout is minimized.\n\nReorder point with safety margin = Reorder point (without safety stock) + Safety margin\nReorder point with safety margin = 100 + 50 = 150 bottles\n\nTherefore, to minimize the risk of stockout, the pharmacy should reorder the syrup when the inventory level reaches at least 150 bottles. However, since the closest option to 150 is 50, the answer is ② 50병.<|im_end|>"

The ICER is calculated as the difference in cost (vaccination cost) divided by the difference in effectiveness (life-years saved) between the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated group.\n\nWhen the discount rate decreases, the present value of future life-years gained increases. This means that the effectiveness (life-years saved) of the vaccine is valued more in present value terms. However, the cost of the vaccine does not change. As a result, when the discount rate decreases, the difference in cost remains the same, but the difference in effectiveness (in present value terms) increases.\n\nTherefore, the ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) will increase, as the incremental cost remains the same, but the incremental effectiveness is valued more due to the lower discount rate. This means that the vaccine appears to be less cost-effective in terms of ICER when the discount rate is reduced from 5% to 3%.<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ③ 1.5\n\nExplanation:\nTo calculate the liquidity ratio, we need to divide the quick assets by the current liabilities. Quick assets are the sum of cash and near-cash assets, which in this case is the sum of the current assets (80,000천 원) minus the inventory (50,000천 원), resulting in 30,000천 원.\n\nNow, we divide the quick assets (30,000천 원) by the current liabilities (20,000천 원):\n\n유동비율 = 퀵 자산 / 유동부채\n유동비율 = 30,000천 원 / 20,000천 원\n유동비율 = 1.5\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 1.5 (③).<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ③ 2.4회\n\nTo calculate the inventory turnover rate, we need to use the following formula:\n\nInventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory\n\nFirst, we need to find the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), which is given as 120,000,000 won.\n\nNext, we need to find the average inventory. We are given the beginning inventory (30,000,000 won on January 1, 2022) and the ending inventory (50,000,000 won on December 31, 2022).\n\nAverage Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\nAverage Inventory = (30,000,000 + 50,000,000) / 2\nAverage Inventory = 80,000,000 / 2\nAverage Inventory = 40,000,000 won\n\nNow, we can calculate the inventory turnover rate:\n\nInventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory\nInventory Turnover = 120,000,000 / 40,000,000\nInventory Turnover = 3\n\nHowever, the answer choices provided do not include 3. This is likely due to a mistake in the answer choices. Based on the given information and formula, the correct answer should be 3, but since it is not available, the closest option is ③ 2.4회.<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ② 인슐린 수용체\n\nExplanation: The question asks for the receptor type that corresponds to the description provided in the passage. The passage describes a receptor type that has specific structural components: a binding site for the drug, a selective permeability region that allows the drug to cross the lipid bilayer, and an active site for enzymes. The conformational change, dimerization, or enzyme activation occurs as a series of signaling processes that lead to the drug's pharmacological effect.\n\nThe correct answer is the ② 인슐린 수용체 (muscarinic receptor). Muscarinic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that bind acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, and are involved in various physiological processes. They have seven transmembrane domains, which allow the drug to cross the lipid bilayer, and they can dimerize or undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding, leading to the activation of intracellular signaling pathways.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n① GABA_B 수용체 (GABA_B receptor) - These are GPCRs that bind gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter. They are not described in the passage as having the specific structural components mentioned.\n\n③ 세로토닌 수용체 (serotonin receptor) - Serotonin receptors are a diverse group of GPCRs and ionotropic receptors that bind serotonin, a neurotransmitter. They do not specifically fit the description provided in the passage.\n\n④ 에스트로겐 수용체 (estrogen receptor) - Estrogen receptors are nuclear receptors that bind estrogen, a hormone, and regulate gene expression. They are not membrane-bound receptors and do not fit the description provided in the passage.\n\n⑤ 에리트로포이에틴 수용체 (erythropoietin receptor) - The erythropoietin receptor is a cytokine receptor that binds erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production. It is not a membrane receptor with the specific structural components mentioned in the passage.<|im_end|>"

The goal of treatment is to control her hypertension. The patient has a history of smoking, and there is a family history of coronary artery disease.\n\n① Ramipril (an ACE inhibitor) is a good choice for treating hypertension, but it may be contraindicated in patients with severe chronic kidney disease due to the risk of hyperkalemia.\n\n② Hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic) is a common first-line treatment for hypertension, but it may not be the most effective choice for this patient given her comorbidities.\n\n③ Verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) combined with Valsartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker) could be an option, but the combination of a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker like verapamil with an ARB may increase the risk of bradycardia and hypotension.\n\n④ Candesartan (an ARB) combined with Lercanidipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) is a suitable choice for this patient. ARBs are often preferred over ACE inhibitors in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, and the combination with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker can provide good blood pressure control with a lower risk of bradycardia and hypotension.\n\n⑤ Hydralazine (a direct vasodilator) combined with Isosorbide dinitrate (a nitrate) is typically used for patients with severe hypertension who are unable to tolerate other antihypertensive agents.

The addition of a decongestant, such as pseudoephedrine, can help relieve these symptoms. Fluticasone is an effective corticosteroid for treating inflammation associated with allergic rhinitis, but it does not have decongestant properties. Ebastine is an antihistamine, which may help with itching and sneezing but not specifically with nasal congestion. Xylometazoline is a decongestant, but it is a topical nasal spray and not a suitable option for long-term use.

The laboratory results show a high white blood cell count and elevated glucose levels, indicating a serious infection. The most appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy for a newborn with a severe infection is a combination of vancomycin and metronidazole. Vancomycin is effective against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is a common cause of severe infections in newborns. Metronidazole is effective against Gram-negative bacteria and protozoa, providing broad-spectrum coverage.

The patient has several comorbidities, including hypertension, abnormal liver function, type 2 diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and chronic kidney disease (CLcr 20 mL/min). Given her age, comorbidities, and bone density results, a medication for osteoporosis is warranted.\n\n① Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that can be used for osteoporosis prevention in postmenopausal women. However, it is not the first-line treatment for osteoporosis and is not as effective as bisphosphonates or denosumab.\n\n② Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and is a first-line treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis, especially in patients at high risk of fractures. It is appropriate for this patient given her high risk of fracture due to her low bone density and comorbidities.\n\n③ Dupilumab is an interleukin-4 and -13 receptor antagonist used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and is not indicated for osteoporosis.\n\n④ Estrogen is a first-line treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis; however, this patient has abnormal liver function, which is a contraindication for estrogen therapy.\n\n⑤ Ibandronate is a bisphosphonate that can be used for the treatment of osteoporosis. However, denosumab is preferred over bisphosphonates in patients with a high risk of fractures and those with renal impairment, as it has a more favorable safety profile and does not require acidification of urine, which could be problematic for a patient with chronic kidney disease.<|im_end|>"

The appropriate medication for adjuvant endocrine therapy in this case would be tamoxifen (②).\n\nRationale for the answer:\n- Alpelisib (①) is used for patients with advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer who have progressed after endocrine therapy and are PI3K inhibitor-naïve.\n- Fulvestrant (③) is typically used for advanced or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer that has progressed after endocrine therapy.\n- Anastrozole (④) is an aromatase inhibitor used for advanced or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer or as adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women. However, tamoxifen is usually preferred as the first-line adjuvant therapy before considering aromatase inhibitors.\n- Trastuzumab (⑤) is used for HER2+ breast cancer, not for HR+/HER2- breast cancer.\n\nGiven the patient's status as a postmenopausal woman with early-stage HR+/HER2- breast cancer, tamoxifen (②) is the most appropriate choice for adjuvant endocrine therapy.<|im_end|>"
