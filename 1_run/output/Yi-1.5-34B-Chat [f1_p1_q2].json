        "response": ": ② B\n\nExplanation: Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires biotransformation to produce an active metabolite. This conversion involves the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, specifically CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, which oxidize the prodrug at the thienyl ring, creating a reactive thiol group (-SH). This thiol group then forms a disulfide bond with the cysteine residue on the platelet membrane receptor, thereby activating the drug's antiplatelet effect.\n\nGiven the question's focus on the site oxidized by CYP enzymes in the activation metabolism of clopidogrel, the correct answer is ② B, referring to the thienyl ring of clopidogrel where the oxidation by CYP enzymes occurs. The other options (A, C, D, E) are not specified in the context provided and do not directly relate to the site of oxidation in the metabolism of clopidogrel.\n\nThe mention of Drug A, its active metabolite formation under acidic conditions, and its inhibitory effect on CYP enzymes (leading to a caution against use with clopidogrel), while relevant to the broader discussion of drug interactions and metabolism, does not directly inform the specific site of oxidation in clopidogrel's metabolism. Therefore, the focus remains on the thienyl ring of clopidogrel as the site oxidized by CYP enzymes during its activation metabolism.<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ② Simvastatin 20 mg\n\nExplanation:\nThe patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and a transient ischemic attack, which puts him at high risk for cardiovascular events. Dyslipidemia, with a total cholesterol of 210 mg/dL and LDL-C of 165 mg/dL, is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Statin therapy is the cornerstone of managing dyslipidemia in high-risk patients.\n\nAmong the options provided, simvastatin is a suitable choice for this patient. Statin selection is often based on cost, side effect profile, and individual response. Simvastatin is a well-established statin with a wide range of doses, making it a reasonable choice for this patient. The starting dose for simvastatin in patients with a similar lipid profile and cardiovascular risk is typically 20 mg once daily.\n\nThe other options are not incorrect per se but may be less commonly chosen for various reasons:\n\n① Lovastatin is an older statin and may be less potent than some of the newer options.\n③ Fluvastatin is primarily used in patients with hepatic impairment due to its first-pass metabolism, which is not an issue in this case.\n④ Pravastatin may be less effective for LDL-C reduction compared to simvastatin.\n⑤ Rosuvastatin, while very effective, may be more expensive than simvastatin and is not necessarily indicated for this patient.\n\nPlease note that this response is for educational purposes and does not replace professional medical advice.

Sudden discontinuation of beta-blockers can lead to a worsening of the underlying condition, including acute tachycardia, hypertension, and ischemic symptoms. Therefore, the patient should be counseled on the importance of continuing the medication as prescribed and discussing any concerns or plans to discontinue the medication with their healthcare provider.\n\nThe other options are not correct for the following reasons:\n\n① Valsartan tablet: Discontinuation of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) like valsartan does not typically result in acute tachycardia or hypertension.\n② Aspirin tablet: Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent and does not cause acute tachycardia or hypertension upon discontinuation.\n④ Clopidogrel tablet: This is another antiplatelet agent, and its discontinuation does not typically result in acute tachycardia or hypertension.\n⑤ Isosorbide mononitrate tablet: Although discontinuing nitrates can lead to a withdrawal headache, it does not cause acute tachycardia or hypertension.<|im_end|>"

Calculate QALYs for each drug:\n- Drug A: (1 year * 0.8) + (0.5 years * 0.4) = 0.8 + 0.2 = 1 QALY\n- Drug B: (2 years * 0.8) + (1 year * 0.4) = 1.6 + 0.4 = 2 QALYs\n\n2. Calculate incremental QALYs:\nIncremental QALYs = QALYs of Drug B - QALYs of Drug A = 2 - 1 = 1 QALY\n\n3. Calculate incremental costs:\nIncremental costs = Cost of Drug B - Cost of Drug A = 30 million won - 10 million won = 20 million won\n\n4. Calculate incremental cost-utility ratio:\nIncremental cost-utility ratio = Incremental costs / Incremental QALYs = 20 million won / 1 QALY = 20 million won/QALY\n\nSince the incremental cost-utility ratio (20 million won/QALY) is below the threshold of 40 million won/QALY, the new anticancer drug B is considered cost-effective. On the cost-effectiveness plane, this would be represented by option ② b.<|im_end|>"

When the diameter of the spherical particles is reduced from 2 mm to 0.2 mm, the surface area of the particles increases by a factor of 100 (since the surface area of a sphere is proportional to the square of its diameter).\n\nSince the dissolution rate is directly proportional to the surface area, the dissolution rate will also increase by a factor of 100. In the original condition, 3 mg of aspirin dissolved in 1 minute. Therefore, with the increased dissolution rate, the expected release amount of aspirin in 1 minute would be 3 mg × 100 = 300 mg.<|im_end|>"

Therefore, a resolution of exactly 5 would be considered a resolution of approximately 10 in terms of its practical significance for separation purposes, especially in the context of a multiple-choice exam where such nuances in interpretation might be expected. Thus, the answer is ④ 10, reflecting the practical interpretation of resolution effectiveness.<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ② hydrolysis | acetic acid | salicylic acid\n\nExplanation:\nThe question describes a situation where aspirin tablets were stored under high temperature and humidity conditions, leading to an irritating odor and the appearance of two peaks in the liquid chromatography analysis. The retention times of the peaks are 5.0 min and 10.0 min, and the mobile phase retention time is 2.5 min.\n\nAspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is known to undergo hydrolysis under certain conditions, such as high temperature and humidity, to form salicylic acid and acetic acid. Hydrolysis is the process of breaking a chemical bond by adding water. In the case of aspirin, the acetyl group is cleaved from the salicylic acid moiety, resulting in the formation of salicylic acid and acetic acid.\n\nGiven the analysis conditions and the nature of the detected peaks, it is reasonable to conclude that the impurity formed (a) is due to hydrolysis, and the compounds eluted at 5 min and 10 min (b) are acetic acid and salicylic acid, respectively. This is because the shorter retention time is typically associated with the more polar compound, which in this case is acetic acid, and the longer retention time is associated with the less polar compound, which is salicylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ② hydrolysis | acetic acid | salicylic acid.<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ②\n\nExplanation:\n① The monomer does not have a quaternary structure because the quaternary structure refers to the arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) in a protein molecule. The monomer is a single polypeptide chain.\n\n② The isoelectric point (pI) of the protein is 8, which means that at pH 8, the protein has a net charge of zero. Since the pH of the solution is lower than the pI (pH 5 < pI 8), the protein carries a positive charge.\n\n③ The melting temperature of the monomer is 60℃, which means that at 80℃, the protein is expected to lose its tertiary structure due to denaturation. Therefore, the tertiary structure is not the same at 80℃ and 25℃.\n\n④ Size exclusion liquid chromatography is used to separate proteins based on their size, not to confirm their secondary structure. The secondary structure can be confirmed using techniques such as circular dichroism or Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.\n\n⑤ Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is a detergent that disrupts the non-covalent interactions holding the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins. When SDS is added to a protein solution, it will lead to the unfolding of the protein and the formation of a protein-SDS complex. The secondary structure will not be maintained in the presence of a high concentration of SDS.<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ② Adjust pH to 3.0\n\nExplanation:\nTo increase the retention time of aspirin, we need to make the mobile phase less polar. Aspirin is a weak acid with a pKa of 3.5, meaning it can exist in both ionized and non-ionized forms. When the pH of the mobile phase is lower than the pKa, aspirin will predominantly exist in its non-ionized, more polar form. This will result in a longer retention time as it interacts more with the stationary phase.\n\nAdjusting the pH to 3.0 (more acidic) will favor the non-ionized form of aspirin, increasing its retention time. The other options do not directly affect the ionization state of aspirin as effectively as changing the pH.<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ② 1.0\n\nExplanation:\nTo determine the value of A, we need to calculate the amount of lead standard solution to add to the control solution to ensure that the lead concentration does not exceed 5 ppm (parts per million).\n\nGiven that the lead concentration in the lead standard solution is 0.01 mg/mL, we can set up an equation to find the volume (A) needed to maintain the lead concentration below 5 ppm in a 50 mL solution.\n\nLet's denote the mass of the drug as m (2.0 g), the volume of the lead standard solution to be added as V (A in mL), and the maximum allowed lead concentration as C (5 ppm or 5 mg/kg, since 1 ppm = 1 mg/kg).\n\nThe mass of lead in the lead standard solution is 0.01 mg/mL * A mL.\n\nThe mass of the drug is 2.0 g, which is equal to 2000 mg (since 1 g = 1000 mg).\n\nWe want the lead concentration in the control solution to be less than 5 ppm, so:\n\n(0.01 mg/mL * A mL) / 2000 mg ≤ 5 mg/kg\n\nSolving for A:\n\n0.01A / 2000 ≤ 5\n0.01A ≤ 10000\nA ≤ 1000000\n\nSince we are given options in whole numbers, the closest value to our upper limit is 1.0 mL.

        "response": ": ② Pseudo-zero-order | First-order\n\nExplanation: In the given scenario, the dissolution rate of the suspension follows pseudo-zero-order kinetics (c). This means that the rate of dissolution is independent of the concentration of the drug in the suspension and is primarily governed by the surface area available for dissolution. Therefore, when the solid drug is present inside the semipermeable membrane (A), the release rate reaction order is pseudo-zero-order.\n\nAfter the dissolution is complete (B), the drug is no longer in contact with the semipermeable membrane, and the release rate reaction order would typically follow first-order kinetics. First-order kinetics is common for the release of dissolved drug molecules through a membrane or diffusion-controlled processes, as the rate of release depends on the concentration of the drug on the side of the membrane. Thus, the release rate reaction order after dissolution is complete (B) is first-order.<|im_end|>"

This method is based on the Beer-Lambert Law, which states that the absorbance of a solution is directly proportional to the concentration of the absorbing species and the path length of the light through the sample. In the case of thiamine hydrochloride, the UV-visible spectrophotometry measures the absorbance at the maximum absorption peak (239 nm), which corresponds to the electronic transitions of the outermost electrons in the thiamine hydrochloride molecules. These transitions involve the promotion of electrons from lower-energy ground states to higher-energy excited states when they absorb photons of light.

The best approach in this situation is to switch to a combined inhaler containing both an inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide) and a long-acting beta-agonist (formoterol). This combination therapy will provide better symptom control and reduce the frequency of exacerbations.

Beta-blockers can block the effects of adrenaline, which is responsible for increasing blood glucose levels in response to low blood sugar. This can result in a reduced ability to perceive hypoglycemic symptoms, such as sweating, trembling, and hunger, which are typically triggered by the body's stress response to low blood sugar. Therefore, the most likely medication responsible for the patient not feeling any particular hypoglycemic symptoms is Atenolol.<|im_end|>"

It is not recommended for use in breastfeeding mothers because it can pass into breast milk and may cause adverse effects in the infant, such as increased heart rate, restlessness, and irritability. Therefore, it is appropriate to inquire with the doctor about the appropriateness of pseudoephedrine for a breastfeeding patient.\n\nThe other medications listed are generally considered safe for use in breastfeeding mothers:\n\n- Amoxicillin is an antibiotic that is not expected to have any negative effects on the infant when used in appropriate doses.\n- Acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) is a pain reliever and fever reducer that is considered safe for use in breastfeeding mothers.\n- Vitamin C is not only safe but also beneficial for breastfeeding mothers, as it helps to maintain adequate levels of this important nutrient in the body.\n- Saline nasal spray is a safe and effective option for relieving nasal congestion without the risk of drug exposure to the infant.<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ② Increase | Decrease\n\nExplanation:\nThe reversible inhibitor described binds to the enzyme-substrate complex (E-S), which means it is a competitive inhibitor. Competitive inhibitors compete with the substrate for the active site of the enzyme.\n\n1. Apparent Km: Km is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax. In the presence of a competitive inhibitor, the apparent Km increases because a higher substrate concentration is required to achieve the same reaction rate as in the absence of the inhibitor. This is because the inhibitor competes with the substrate for the enzyme's active site, making it harder for the substrate to bind.\n\n2. Apparent Vmax: Vmax is the maximum reaction rate that can be achieved by the enzyme when all active sites are saturated with the substrate. In the presence of a competitive inhibitor, the Vmax remains unchanged because, in theory, the reaction rate can still reach its maximum if the substrate concentration is high enough to outcompete the inhibitor. However, in practical terms, the maximum velocity may be lower due to the inhibitor's presence, but the Vmax parameter itself does not change as it represents the theoretical maximum.<|im_end|>"

        "response": ": ④ Capping – Croscarmellose sodium\n\nExplanation:\nCapping is a tabletting problem where the excipients or drug substances adhere to the punches of the tablet press. In this case, the excipient that should be increased to improve the issue of sticking to the punch is Croscarmellose sodium.\n\nCroscarmellose sodium is a commonly used excipient in tablet formulations due to its excellent flow properties, compressibility, and its ability to rapidly disintegrate in water, which is beneficial for immediate-release formulations. In this formulation, increasing the amount of Croscarmellose sodium can help to reduce the sticking of other components to the punch faces during tablet compression.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n① Capping – Lactose monohydrate: Lactose monohydrate is a widely used diluent and does not typically cause capping issues.\n② Picking – Magnesium stearate: Magnesium stearate is often used as a lubricant to prevent sticking and to ensure proper tablet ejection. Picking refers to the tearing of the tablet coating at the edges, which is not the issue described in the question.\n③ Splitting – Microcrystalline cellulose: Splitting refers to the breaking of tablets into pieces during handling or packaging, which is not related to sticking to the punch.\n⑤ Sticking – Croscarmellose sodium: Although increasing Croscarmellose sodium can help to prevent sticking, this option incorrectly describes the issue as sticking rather than capping.<|im_end|>"
