Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n0.5 = Kf * (2.0 g / M1)\n2.0 = Kf * (4.0 g / M2)\n\nWhere:\nM1 = molecular weight of drug A\nM2 = molecular weight of drug B\n\nDividing the second equation by the first equation, we get:\n\n2.0 / 0.5 = (Kf * (4.0 g / M2)) / (Kf * (2.0 g / M1))\n4 = (4.0 g / M2) / (2.0 g / M1)\n4 = (4.0 g * M1) / (2.0 g * M2)\n4 = 2 * (M1 / M2)\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n4 = 2 * (M1 / M2)\n2 = M1 / M2\n2M2 = M1\n\nSince the molecular weight of drug A is given as 186 g/mol, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n2M2 = 186\nM2 = 186 / 2\nM2 = 93\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of drug B is 93 g/mol.\n\nThe correct answer is ② 93."

The balanced equation for the reaction is:\n\nAgNO3 + NH4SCN → AgSCN + NH4NO3\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that the mole ratio between AgNO3 and NH4SCN is 1:1. This means that for every mole of NH4SCN used, one mole of AgNO3 is consumed.\n\nGiven that the concentration of NH4SCN is 0.1 mol/L and the volume is 100 mL (0.1 L), we can calculate the number of moles of NH4SCN:\n\nmoles of NH4SCN = concentration × volume\n                 = 0.1 mol/L × 0.1 L\n                 = 0.01 mol\n\nSince the mole ratio between AgNO3 and NH4SCN is 1:1, the number of moles of AgNO3 corresponding to 0.01 mol of NH4SCN is also 0.01 mol.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ① 0.01."

Therefore, the ratio of KIO3 to KI is 5:3.\n\nGiven that the concentration of KIO3 is 0.05 mol/L, we can calculate the number of moles of KIO3 in 1.0 mL (0.001 L) of the solution:\n0.05 mol/L × 0.001 L = 0.00005 mol\n\nTo find the number of moles of KI that correspond to this amount of KIO3, we can use the ratio of 5:3:\n0.00005 mol KIO3 × (3 mol KI / 5 mol KIO3) = 0.00003 mol KI\n\nFinally, we convert the moles of KI to millimoles (mmol):\n0.00003 mol KI × 1000 mmol/mol = 0.03 mmol KI\n\nTherefore, the answer is ③ 0.1."

Therefore, the total dose of cefpodoxime per day is 6 mL x 3 = 18 mL.\n\nSince the concentration of cefpodoxime in the dry syrup is 50 mg/5 mL, we can calculate the total dose of cefpodoxime in milligrams: 18 mL x (50 mg/5 mL) = 180 mg.\n\nNow, we divide the total dose of cefpodoxime (180 mg) by the child's weight (20 kg) to find the daily dose per kilogram of body weight: 180 mg / 20 kg = 9 mg/kg/day.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ④ 9 mg/kg/day."

        "response": "To calculate the weight of the dry syrup powder to be used, we need to determine the total dose of clarithromycin for the 5-day treatment period.\n\nThe patient weighs 10 kg, and the prescribed dose is 7.5 mg/kg per dose. Therefore, the dose per dose for the patient is 7.5 mg/kg x 10 kg = 75 mg.\n\nThe patient needs to take the medication twice daily, so the total daily dose is 75 mg x 2 = 150 mg.\n\nSince the medication is taken at 12-hour intervals, the patient will take the medication for 5 days, resulting in a total of 10 doses.\n\nTherefore, the total dose for the 5-day treatment period is 150 mg/dose x 10 doses = 1500 mg.\n\nThe concentration of the dry syrup is 125 mg/5 mL. To calculate the volume of the dry syrup powder needed, we can use the following equation:\n\nVolume (mL) = Total dose (mg) / Concentration (mg/mL)\n\nVolume (mL) = 1500 mg / 125 mg/5 mL = 60 mL\n\nThe weight of the dry syrup powder in a 100 mL bottle is 70 g. To calculate the weight of the dry syrup powder needed for 60 mL, we can use the following equation:\n\nWeight (g) = Volume (mL) x Weight of dry syrup powder in a 100 mL bottle / 100 mL\n\nWeight (g) = 60 mL x 70 g / 100 mL = 42 g\n\nTherefore, the weight of the dry syrup powder to be used is 42 g.\n\nThe correct answer is ⑤ 42 g."
