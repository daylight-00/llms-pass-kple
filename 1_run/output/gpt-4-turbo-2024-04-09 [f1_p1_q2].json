Calculate the expected deaths for each age group:\n   - For 20-39 years: \\(500,000 \\times \\frac{2}{100,000} = 10 \\) deaths\n   - For 40-59 years: \\(800,000 \\times \\frac{4}{100,000} = 32 \\) deaths\n   - For 60 years and over: \\(900,000 \\times \\frac{12}{100,000} = 108 \\) deaths\n\n2. Sum the expected deaths across all age groups:\n   - Total expected deaths = \\(10 + 32 + 108 = 150\\) deaths\n\n3. Calculate the expected number of deaths per 100,000 population:\n   - Total population = 2,200,000\n   - Expected deaths per 100,000 = \\(\\frac{150}{2,200,000} \\times 100,000 = 6.82\\) deaths per 100,000\n\nHowever, the options provided (150, 200, 250, 300, 350) do not match the calculated value of 6.82 deaths per 100,000. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the options provided. Given the context and the calculation, none of the options accurately reflect the calculated expected number of deaths per 100,000. Please review the question or the options provided. If the question intends to ask for the total expected deaths (which was calculated as 150), then the answer would be:\n\n① 150 people"
