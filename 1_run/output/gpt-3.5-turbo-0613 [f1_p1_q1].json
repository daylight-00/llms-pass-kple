This means that for every 5 moles of H2O2, we need 2 moles of KMnO4.\n\nIn this question, we have a 0.1 mol/L H2O2 solution with a volume of 50 mL. To find the number of moles of H2O2, we can use the formula:\n\nmoles = concentration × volume\n\nmoles = 0.1 mol/L × 0.05 L = 0.005 mol\n\nSince the stoichiometric ratio is 5:2, we can calculate the number of moles of KMnO4 needed:\n\nmoles of KMnO4 = (moles of H2O2 × 2) / 5\n\nmoles of KMnO4 = (0.005 mol × 2) / 5 = 0.002 mol\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the 0.1 mol/L KMnO4 solution needed:\n\nvolume = moles / concentration\n\nvolume = 0.002 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02 L = 20 mL\n\nTherefore, the answer is ② 20."

The comparison solution contains 2.0 mL of lead standard solution. 1.0 mL of the lead standard solution contains 0.01 mg of lead (Pb).\n\nTo calculate the limit of lead (Pb) in ppm, we need to convert the amount of lead (Pb) in mg to ppm.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n\nAmount of lead (Pb) in mg = 0.01 mg\nAmount of d-chlorpheniramine maleate in g = 1.0 g\n\nLimit of lead (Pb) in ppm = (Amount of lead (Pb) in mg / Amount of d-chlorpheniramine maleate in g) * 1000\n\nUsing the given values:\n\nLimit of lead (Pb) in ppm = (0.01 mg / 1.0 g) * 1000 = 10 ppm\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ④ 10."

To calculate the age-standardized mortality rate, we need to use the population of each age group and the standardized lung cancer mortality rate for each age group.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of expected deaths for each age group by multiplying the population of each age group by the standardized lung cancer mortality rate for that age group:\n\nExpected deaths for age group 20-59: 500,000 * (2/100,000) = 10\nExpected deaths for age group 60 and above: 900,000 * (10/100,000) = 90\n\nNext, we calculate the total expected deaths by summing up the expected deaths for each age group:\n\nTotal expected deaths = 10 + 90 = 100\n\nFinally, we calculate the age-standardized mortality rate by dividing the total expected deaths by the total population and multiplying by 100,000:\n\nAge-standardized mortality rate = (100 / 1,400,000) * 100,000 = 7.14 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\n\nTherefore, the answer is ④ 7."

The freezing point depression of the 1% sodium cetirizine solution is given as 0.13℃, and the freezing point depression of a 0.9% NaCl solution is given as 0.52℃.\n\nTo calculate the amount of NaCl needed, we can use the formula:\n\nΔT = Kf * m\n\nWhere ΔT is the freezing point depression, Kf is the cryoscopic constant, and m is the molality of the solute.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the molality of the 1% sodium cetirizine solution:\n\nmolality = (1g/100mL) / (58.5g/mol) = 0.017 mol/kg\n\nNext, we can calculate the molality of the 0.9% NaCl solution:\n\nmolality = (0.9g/100mL) / (58.5g/mol) = 0.015 mol/kg\n\nNow, we can calculate the amount of NaCl needed to make the 1% sodium cetirizine solution isotonic:\n\nΔT = Kf * (molality of NaCl)\n\n0.13℃ = 0.52℃ * (molality of NaCl)\n\nmolality of NaCl = 0.13℃ / 0.52℃ = 0.25 mol/kg\n\nFinally, we can calculate the amount of NaCl needed:\n\nmass of NaCl = (molality of NaCl) * (molar mass of NaCl) * (mass of solvent)\n\nmass of NaCl = (0.25 mol/kg) * (58.5 g/mol) * (0.1 kg) = 1.46 g\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ② 1/4."

We can use the first-order reaction equation to solve for the time it takes for the concentration to decrease from 5 mg/mL to 0.5 mg/mL.\n\nThe first-order reaction equation is given by:\nln(A/A₀) = -kt\n\nWhere:\nA = final concentration (0.5 mg/mL)\nA₀ = initial concentration (5 mg/mL)\nk = reaction rate constant (2.3×10^-3 h^-1)\nt = time\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation, we have:\nln(0.5/5) = -(2.3×10^-3) t\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nln(0.1) = -(2.3×10^-3) t\n\nUsing the property lnA = 2.3 logA, we can rewrite the equation as:\n2.3 log(0.1) = -(2.3×10^-3) t\n\nSimplifying further, we have:\nlog(0.1) = -10^-3 t\n\nTaking the antilog of both sides, we get:\n0.1 = 10^(-10^-3 t)\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n10^(-1) = 10^(-10^-3 t)\n\nSince the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:\n-1 = -10^-3 t\n\nSolving for t, we get:\nt = 1/10^-3 = 1000\n\nTherefore, the time it takes for the concentration to decrease from 5 mg/mL to 0.5 mg/mL is 1000 hours.\n\nThe correct answer is ④ 1.0×10^3."

The standard reduction potentials for Ce4+ and Fe2+ are given as E°Ce = 1.61 V and E°Fe = 0.77 V, respectively.\n\nTo determine the potential at the equivalence point, we need to calculate the cell potential (Ecell) using the Nernst equation:\n\nEcell = E°cell - (0.0592/n) * log(Q)\n\nWhere:\nEcell = cell potential\nE°cell = standard cell potential\nn = number of electrons transferred in the balanced equation\nQ = reaction quotient\n\nIn this case, n = 1 because one electron is transferred in the balanced equation. The reaction quotient (Q) can be calculated using the concentrations of the reactants at the equivalence point.\n\nAt the equivalence point, the moles of Ce4+ and Fe2+ are equal. Since the initial concentration of both solutions is 0.10 mol/L and the volume of both solutions is 100.0 mL, the moles of Ce4+ and Fe2+ at the equivalence point are both 0.010 mol.\n\nTherefore, at the equivalence point, [Ce4+] = [Fe2+] = 0.010 mol/L.\n\nPlugging these values into the Nernst equation:\n\nEcell = E°cell - (0.0592/1) * log(0.010/0.010)\nEcell = E°cell - (0.0592/1) * log(1)\nEcell = E°cell\n\nTherefore, the potential at the equivalence point is equal to the standard cell potential, which is 1.61 V.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ④ 1.61."

Conductivity is directly related to the concentration of ions in a solution. \n\nH2CO3 (carbonic acid) dissociates into H+ and HCO3- ions, while NH4OH (ammonium hydroxide) dissociates into NH4+ and OH- ions. NH4Cl dissociates into NH4+ and Cl- ions.\n\nTo determine the conductivity, we need to consider the concentration of ions in each solution. \n\nIn option ①, H2CO3 is present at a concentration of 0.001 mol/L. It will dissociate into H+ and HCO3- ions, but the concentration is relatively low.\n\nIn option ②, NH4OH is present at a concentration of 0.001 mol/L. It will dissociate into NH4+ and OH- ions, but the concentration is relatively low.\n\nIn option ③, H2CO3 is present at a higher concentration of 0.1 mol/L. This means there will be more H+ and HCO3- ions in the solution, resulting in higher conductivity compared to option ①.\n\nIn option ④, NH4OH is present at a higher concentration of 0.1 mol/L. This means there will be more NH4+ and OH- ions in the solution, resulting in higher conductivity compared to option ②.\n\nIn option ⑤, NH4Cl is present at a concentration of 0.1 mol/L. It will dissociate into NH4+ and Cl- ions, resulting in a higher concentration of ions compared to options ① and ②.\n\nTherefore, the solution with the lowest conductivity is option ①, 0.001 mol/L H2CO3."

The balanced equation for the reaction between EDTA and Al2O3 is:\n\nAl2O3 + 6H+ + 2EDTA → 2Al(EDTA)2- + 3H2O\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 2 moles of Al2O3 react with 2 moles of EDTA. Therefore, the molar ratio between Al2O3 and EDTA is 1:1.\n\nGiven that the molar concentration of EDTA is 0.05 mol/L and we have 1 mL of EDTA, we can calculate the amount of EDTA in moles:\n\n0.05 mol/L × 0.001 L = 0.00005 mol\n\nSince the molar ratio between Al2O3 and EDTA is 1:1, the amount of Al2O3 in moles is also 0.00005 mol.\n\nTo convert moles to grams, we need to multiply by the molar mass of Al2O3:\n\n0.00005 mol × 102 g/mol = 0.0051 g\n\nFinally, to convert grams to milligrams, we multiply by 1000:\n\n0.0051 g × 1000 mg/g = 5.1 mg\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ④ 5.10."

The difference in cost is 5,000 - 2,000 = 3,000.\n\nThe effectiveness of drug A is 0.65 QALYs, and the effectiveness of drug B is 0.6 QALYs. The difference in effectiveness is 0.65 - 0.6 = 0.05.\n\nTo calculate the ICER, we divide the difference in cost by the difference in effectiveness: 3,000 / 0.05 = 60,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ④ 6,000."

The given value for L_iso is 3.4.\n\nThe freezing point depression (ΔTf) is related to the molality (m) of the solute by the equation ΔTf = Kf * m, where Kf is the cryoscopic constant.\n\nSince the question states that we can ignore the difference between molar concentration and molality, we can use the equation ΔTf = Kf * m to find the molality of the solution.\n\nGiven that ΔTf = 0.52°C and Kf = 3.4, we can rearrange the equation to solve for m:\n\nm = ΔTf / Kf\nm = 0.52°C / 3.4\n\nCalculating this value, we find that m ≈ 0.153 mol/kg.\n\nTo convert molality to molar concentration, we need to know the density of the solution. However, this information is not provided in the question. Therefore, we cannot determine the molar concentration of the solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ⑤."

The formation constant (Kf) for this complex ion is given as 1.0×10^21.\n\nTo find the concentration of Ag⁺ ions in the solution, we need to consider the reaction between Ag⁺ and S2O3²⁻ ions:\n\nAg⁺ + 2S2O3²⁻ → [Ag(S2O3)2]3-\n\nFrom the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of Ag⁺ reacts with 2 moles of S2O3²⁻ to form 1 mole of [Ag(S2O3)2]3-. \n\nGiven that the initial concentration of AgNO3 is 0.060 mol and the initial concentration of Na2S2O3 is 0.32 mol, we can calculate the concentration of Ag⁺ ions in the solution as follows:\n\nInitial moles of Ag⁺ = 0.060 mol\nMoles of Ag⁺ reacted = 0.060 mol\nMoles of [Ag(S2O3)2]3- formed = 0.060 mol\n\nSince 1 mole of Ag⁺ reacts to form 1 mole of [Ag(S2O3)2]3-, the concentration of Ag⁺ ions in the solution is equal to the moles of Ag⁺ ions divided by the volume of the solution (1 L):\n\nConcentration of Ag⁺ = 0.060 mol / 1 L = 0.060 mol/L\n\nTherefore, the concentration of Ag⁺ ions in the solution is 0.060 mol/L.\n\nThe correct answer is ① 6.7×10^-25."

The patient is currently taking methotrexate, cyclosporine, folic acid, and calcipotriol. \n\nBased on the patient's lipid profile, the most appropriate additional medication therapy would be a statin. Statins are the first-line treatment for dyslipidemia and are effective in reducing LDL-C levels. \n\nAmong the options provided, the most suitable statin for this patient would be pitavastatin (③) at a dose of 4 mg once daily. Pitavastatin has been shown to be effective in reducing LDL-C levels and has a favorable safety profile. It is also less likely to interact with cyclosporine compared to other statins."

To find the amount of dry syrup powder needed, we can use the formula: \nAmount of dry syrup powder = total amount / concentration\n\nAmount of dry syrup powder = 750 mg / 125 mg/5 mL = 60 mL\n\nSince the concentration of the dry syrup powder is 125 mg/5 mL, and the total amount needed is 60 mL, we can calculate the weight of the dry syrup powder using the information provided:\n\nWeight of dry syrup powder = (60 mL / 5 mL) x 70 g = 12 x 70 g = 840 g\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ⑤ 42 g."
