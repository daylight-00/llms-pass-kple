At 4 mL HCl added (before equivalence), we use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n   pH = pKa + log([Base]/[Acid])\n   Here, [Base]/[Acid] = (2-0.8)/(0.8) = 1.5\n\nTherefore, A = 10 mL (equivalence point) and B = 9.4 + log 1.5\n\nThe option that matches this is ①."

Then we can determine where this ratio falls on the cost-effectiveness plane.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n1. QALYs for drug A:\n   (1 year × 0.8) + (0.5 years × 0.4) = 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0 QALY\n\n2. QALYs for drug B:\n   (2 years × 0.8) + (1 year × 0.4) = 1.6 + 0.4 = 2.0 QALYs\n\n3. Incremental QALYs:\n   2.0 - 1.0 = 1.0 QALY\n\n4. Incremental Cost:\n   30 million won - 10 million won = 20 million won\n\n5. ICUR:\n   20 million won / 1.0 QALY = 20 million won/QALY\n\nThe threshold is given as 40 million won/QALY.\n\nThe new drug B provides more QALYs at a higher cost, but the ICUR (20 million won/QALY) is below the threshold of 40 million won/QALY.\n\nThis scenario falls in the northeast quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane and below the threshold line, indicating that the new drug is cost-effective.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n②"

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the concentration of NH4Cl that will prevent Mg(OH)2 precipitation. Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1) First, we need to find the maximum [OH-] that can exist without causing precipitation.\n\n   Ksp = [Mg2+][OH-]2\n   1.0×10^-13 = (1.0×10^-3)[OH-]2\n   [OH-]2 = 1.0×10^-10\n   [OH-] = 1.0×10^-5 mol/L\n\n2) Now, we need to use the Kb of NH4OH to find the [OH-] in the solution:\n\n   Kb = [NH4+][OH-] / [NH4OH] = 1.0×10^-5\n\n3) We want [OH-] to be less than or equal to 1.0×10^-5 mol/L to prevent precipitation. Let's use this value:\n\n   1.0×10^-5 = [NH4+](1.0×10^-5) / 0.1\n   [NH4+] = 0.1 mol/L\n\n4) The [NH4+] comes from the NH4Cl we add. So, the minimum concentration of NH4Cl needed is 0.1 mol/L.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ④ 0.1."

Calculate the concentration in mol/L:\n   337 mg / 337 g/mol = 1 mmol\n   1 mmol in 100 mL = 0.01 M = 1 × 10^-2 M\n\n2. We know:\n   Absorbance (A) = 0.230\n   Path length (l) = 1 cm\n   Concentration (c) = 1 × 10^-2 M\n\n3. Using Beer-Lambert law: A = ε * c * l\n   Where ε is the molar extinction coefficient\n\n4. Rearrange the equation: ε = A / (c * l)\n\n5. Plug in the values:\n   ε = 0.230 / (1 × 10^-2 * 1)\n   ε = 23.0 M^-1 * cm^-1\n\nTherefore, the molar extinction coefficient is 23.0 M^-1 * cm^-1.\n\n④"

Quality control charts typically have control limits set at ±3 standard deviations from the mean, and points falling outside these limits would be considered \"out of control.\" However, without the chart to analyze, it's not possible to count how many batches exceed the UCL or LCL. \n\nFor an OMR exam, you need to examine the chart yourself and count the number of data points that fall beyond the control limits, then select the corresponding answer from the options provided. Since I can't see the data, I cannot determine which of the given options (①, ②, ③, ④, or ⑤) is correct."

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which layer is the upper layer and calculate its mass. Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The water layer contains 10.0% phenol, so it's mostly water.\n2. The phenol layer contains 33.0% water, so it's mostly phenol.\n3. Water has a lower density than phenol (phenol's specific gravity is 1.07), so the water layer will be on top.\n\nNow, let's calculate the mass of the water layer (upper layer):\n\n1. Total mass of the system = 71.0 g (water) + 29.0 g (phenol) = 100.0 g\n2. In the water layer: 90% is water, 10% is phenol\n3. Let x be the mass of the water layer\n\nWe can set up an equation:\n0.90x = amount of water in the water layer\n0.10x = amount of phenol in the water layer\n\nThe amount of phenol in the water layer plus the amount in the phenol layer should equal the total amount of phenol:\n\n0.10x + 0.67(100 - x) = 29\n\nSolving this equation:\n0.10x + 67 - 0.67x = 29\n67 - 0.57x = 29\n38 = 0.57x\nx ≈ 66.7 g\n\nTherefore, the mass of the upper (water) layer is approximately 66.7 g.\n\nThe answer is ④ 66.7."

The key is to recognize that both properties are colligative, meaning they depend on the number of solute particles in solution, not their nature.\n\nThe freezing point depression (ΔTf) is given as 0.34℃, and we're told that the L_iso value (cryoscopic constant) for diphenhydramine hydrochloride is 3.4.\n\nUsing the freezing point depression formula:\nΔTf = Kf * m\nWhere Kf is the cryoscopic constant (L_iso) and m is the molality.\n\n0.34 = 3.4 * m\nm = 0.34 / 3.4 = 0.1 molal\n\nNow, we can use the van 't Hoff equation for osmotic pressure:\nπ = MRT\n\nWhere:\nπ is osmotic pressure\nM is molarity (which we can approximate as molality for dilute solutions)\nR is the gas constant\nT is temperature in Kelvin (20°C + 273 = 293K)\n\nπ = 0.1 * R * 293\n\nπ = 29.3R\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n③"

First, we need to find the freezing point depression of the 1% multivitamin injection:\n   ΔT_{f} (1% multivitamin) = 0.23℃\n\n2. The freezing point depression needed to make it isotonic with blood is:\n   ΔT_{f} (blood) = 0.52℃\n\n3. The additional freezing point depression needed from NaCl is:\n   ΔT_{f} (NaCl needed) = 0.52℃ - 0.23℃ = 0.29℃\n\n4. We know that a 1% NaCl solution causes a 0.58℃ depression. So, to cause a 0.29℃ depression:\n   x% * 0.58℃ = 0.29℃\n   x = 0.29 / 0.58 = 0.5%\n\n5. In 200 mL of solution, 0.5% NaCl would be:\n   0.5% of 200 mL = 0.005 * 200 mL = 1.0 g\n\nTherefore, 1.0 g of sodium chloride is needed.\n\nThe correct answer is ③ 1.0"
