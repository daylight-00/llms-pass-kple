The proportionality constant is called the cryoscopic constant (Kf), which is a property of the solvent. For water, Kf = 1.86 °C·kg/mol.\n\n   ΔTf = Kf × m\n\n2) For drug A:\n   \n   ΔTf(A) = 0.5°C\n   Mass of drug A (mA) = 2.0 g\n   Molecular weight of drug A (MWA) = 186 g/mol\n   \n   We can find the molality of solution A:\n   \n   0.5 = 1.86 × mA\n   mA = 0.5 / 1.86 = 0.269 mol/kg\n\n3) The molality is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. Let the mass of water be x kg.\n\n   mA = moles of A / mass of water\n   0.269 = (2.0 / 186) / x\n   x = (2.0 / 186) / 0.269 = 0.0400 kg = 40.0 g\n\n4) For drug B:\n\n   ΔTf(B) = 2.0°C\n   Mass of drug B (mB) = 4.0 g\n   Molecular weight of drug B (MWB) = unknown\n   Mass of water = 40.0 g (same as for drug A)\n\n   We can find the molality of solution B:\n\n   2.0 = 1.86 × mB\n   mB = 2.0 / 1.86 = 1.075 mol/kg\n\n5) Now we can find the molecular weight of drug B:\n\n   mB = moles of B / mass of water\n   1.075 = (4.0 / MWB) / 0.0400\n   MWB = (4.0 / 1.075) / 0.0400 = 93 g/mol\n\nTherefore, the molecular weight of drug B is 93 g/mol, which corresponds to option ②."

When the particle size is reduced, the surface area increases, leading to a faster dissolution rate.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial particle diameter: 2 mm\n- Initial dissolution amount: 3 mg/min\n- New particle diameter: 0.2 mm\n\nThe surface area of a sphere is proportional to the square of its diameter. Therefore, if the diameter is reduced by a factor of 10 (from 2 mm to 0.2 mm), the surface area will increase by a factor of 100 (10^2).\n\nSince the dissolution rate is directly proportional to the surface area, the new dissolution rate will be 100 times the initial rate.\n\nNew dissolution rate = 100 × 3 mg/min = 300 mg/min\n\nTherefore, the expected release amount of aspirin in 1 minute with the reduced particle size is 300 mg.\n\n⑤"

        "response": "To calculate the molar absorption coefficient (ε) at the maximum absorption wavelength (241 nm), we need to use the Beer-Lambert law:\n\nA = ε × l × c\n\nwhere:\nA = absorbance\nε = molar absorption coefficient (L mol⁻¹ cm⁻¹)\nl = path length (cm)\nc = concentration (mol L⁻¹)\n\nGiven:\n- 10.0 mg of methyltestosterone is dissolved in 100 mL of ethanol.\n- 5 mL of this solution is diluted to 50 mL with ethanol.\n- The path length is 1 cm.\n- The molecular weight of methyltestosterone is M.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the concentration of methyltestosterone in the final test solution.\n\nInitial concentration = (10.0 mg) / (100 mL) = 0.1 mg/mL\nFinal concentration = (0.1 mg/mL) × (5 mL) / (50 mL) = 0.01 mg/mL\n\nTo convert the concentration from mg/mL to mol/L:\nc = (0.01 mg/mL) / (M g/mol) = (0.01 / M) × (1000 mL/L) = (10 / M) mol/L\n\nStep 2: Rearrange the Beer-Lambert law to solve for ε.\n\nε = A / (l × c)\nε = A / [1 cm × (10 / M) mol/L]\nε = (A × M) / 10\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ②: A×M×10.\n\n②"

The test method involves weighing 1.0 g of the drug and following Method 4.\n3. In the control solution, 2.0 mL of lead standard solution is added.\n4. 1.0 mL of the lead standard solution contains 0.01 mg of lead (Pb).\n\nTo determine the limit in ppm, we need to calculate the amount of lead in the control solution and compare it to the weight of the drug sample.\n\nAmount of lead in the control solution:\n- 2.0 mL of lead standard solution is added.\n- 1.0 mL contains 0.01 mg of lead.\n- Therefore, 2.0 mL contains 0.02 mg of lead.\n\nWeight of the drug sample: 1.0 g\n\nTo convert the limit to ppm (parts per million):\nppm = (mg of lead / g of drug sample) × 1,000,000\n     = (0.02 mg / 1.0 g) × 1,000,000\n     = 20 ppm\n\nTherefore, the limit for heavy metals (as lead) in d-chlorpheniramine maleate is 20 ppm.\n\nAnswer: ⑤"

Determine the volume of suspension needed for the calculated dose:\n   160 mg / 5 mL = 240 mg / x mL\n   x = (240 mg × 5 mL) / 160 mg\n   x = 7.5 mL\n\nTherefore, the single dose for the child is 7.5 mL of the acetaminophen suspension, which corresponds to answer ②."

The presence of oxalate crystals in the urine further supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe appropriate treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is the administration of fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor that prevents the metabolism of ethylene glycol into toxic metabolites. Hemodialysis is also indicated to remove ethylene glycol and its metabolites from the blood.\n\nThe other options are not suitable for treating ethylene glycol poisoning:\n- Emesis and gastric lavage are not effective once the ethylene glycol has been absorbed.\n- Inhalation of amyl nitrite is used for cyanide poisoning.\n- Supportive care alone is insufficient for severe ethylene glycol poisoning.\n- The combination of atropine and pralidoxime is used for organophosphate poisoning.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is ③ Administration of fomepizole and hemodialysis."

Let's calculate the moles of KIO3 in this volume:\n\n   Moles of KIO3 = Concentration (mol/L) × Volume (L)\n                  = 0.05 mol/L × 0.001 L\n                  = 0.00005 mol or 0.05 mmol\n\n4) Since 1 mole of KIO3 reacts with 5 moles of KI, 0.00005 moles (or 0.05 mmol) of KIO3 will react with 5 times as much KI:\n\n   Moles of KI = 5 × Moles of KIO3\n               = 5 × 0.00005 mol\n               = 0.00025 mol or 0.25 mmol\n\n5) Therefore, 1.0 mL of 0.05 mol/L KIO3 corresponds to 0.25 mmol of KI.\n\nThe correct answer is ④ 0.125."

        "response": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. The chemical equation for the titration reaction is:\n   Piperazine citrate + Perchloric acid → Piperazine perchlorate + Citric acid\n\n2. From the stoichiometry of the reaction, we can see that 1 mole of piperazine citrate reacts with 1 mole of perchloric acid.\n\n3. The concentration of perchloric acid is 0.1 mol/L. This means that 1 L of this solution contains 0.1 mol of perchloric acid.\n\n4. Therefore, 1 mL (0.001 L) of 0.1 mol/L perchloric acid contains:\n   0.1 mol/L × 0.001 L = 0.0001 mol of perchloric acid\n\n5. Since 1 mole of piperazine citrate reacts with 1 mole of perchloric acid, 0.0001 mol of perchloric acid will react with 0.0001 mol of piperazine citrate.\n\n6. The molecular weight of piperazine citrate is 642. This means that 1 mole of piperazine citrate weighs 642 g.\n\n7. Therefore, 0.0001 mol of piperazine citrate weighs:\n   0.0001 mol × 642 g/mol = 0.0642 g = 64.2 mg\n\nTherefore, the amount of piperazine citrate corresponding to 1 mL of 0.1 mol/L perchloric acid is 64.2 mg.\n\n⑤ 64.2"

        "response": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's calculate the concentration of the solution. We know that 337 mg of thiamine hydrochloride was dissolved in 100 mL of water.\n\n   Concentration = mass / (volume * molecular weight)\n                 = 337 mg / (100 mL * 337 g/mol)\n                 = 0.01 M or 10 mM\n\n2. Now, we can use the Beer-Lambert law to find the molar extinction coefficient. The Beer-Lambert law states that:\n\n   A = ε * c * l\n\n   Where:\n   A is the absorbance (0.230)\n   ε is the molar extinction coefficient (what we're trying to find)\n   c is the concentration (0.01 M)\n   l is the path length (1 cm)\n\n3. Rearranging the equation to solve for ε:\n\n   ε = A / (c * l)\n     = 0.230 / (0.01 M * 1 cm)\n     = 23.0 M^-1 ∙ cm^-1\n\nTherefore, the molar extinction coefficient of thiamine hydrochloride is 23.0 M^-1 ∙ cm^-1.\n\n④"

Voriconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, the enzyme responsible for tacrolimus metabolism. Co-administration of voriconazole can significantly increase tacrolimus levels, leading to tacrolimus toxicity and AKI.\n\nTherefore, the drug-related problem that occurred in this patient is the occurrence of an adverse drug reaction (⑤)."

Without this information, it is not possible to determine which of the given options is correct. Please provide the necessary data if you would like me to attempt calculating the process capability index. I apologize that I cannot be more helpful without additional details."

Let's calculate the moles of EDTA in this volume:\n\n   Moles of EDTA = Concentration × Volume\n                 = 0.05 mol/L × 0.001 L\n                 = 5 × 10^-5 mol\n\n4) Since 3 moles of EDTA react with 1 mole of Al2O3, the moles of Al2O3 that react with 5 × 10^-5 mol of EDTA are:\n\n   Moles of Al2O3 = (5 × 10^-5 mol) / 3\n                  = 1.67 × 10^-5 mol\n\n5) Now, let's convert this to mg of Al2O3:\n\n   Mass of Al2O3 = Moles × Molecular Weight\n                 = (1.67 × 10^-5 mol) × 102 g/mol\n                 = 1.7 × 10^-3 g\n                 = 1.7 mg\n\n6) Looking at the options, the closest answer is ② 5.10×10^-3 mg.\n\nTherefore, the answer is ②."

In competitive inhibition:\n\n③ The apparent Km increases while the apparent Vmax remains unchanged.\n\nThis is because a competitive inhibitor competes with the substrate for binding to the active site of the enzyme. At higher inhibitor concentrations, more enzyme active sites are occupied by the inhibitor, effectively reducing the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate (increased Km). However, at sufficiently high substrate concentrations, the inhibitor can be displaced and the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) can still be reached.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is ③ Apparent Km increases, Apparent Vmax has no change."
