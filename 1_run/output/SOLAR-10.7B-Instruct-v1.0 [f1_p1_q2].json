The correct formula should be (future value × present value factor). In this case, the present value factor for a 5% discount rate is 1 / (1 + 0.05)^1, 1 / (1 + 0.05)^2, and 1 / (1 + 0.05)^3 for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.

To find the number of mL for 240 mg, we set up a proportion: 160 mg / 5 mL = 240 mg / x mL. Solving for x, we get x = (240 mg * 5 mL) / 160 mg = 15 mL / 0.67 = 22.368 mL.

In this case, aspirin dissociates into acetylsalicylic acid and H+.
