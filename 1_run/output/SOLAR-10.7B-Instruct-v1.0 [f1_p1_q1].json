In this case, USL = 520 mg, LSL = 490 mg, and σ = 5.0 mg. Plugging these values into the formula, we get Cp = (520 - 490) / (6 * 5) = 30 / 30 = 1.

Since propofol provides 200 kcal of fat, we have 600 - 200 = 400 kcal remaining to provide through the lipid emulsion. Since the emulsion is 20% fat, we can calculate the volume by dividing the remaining kcal by the fat percentage of the emulsion: 400 kcal / 20% = 400 kcal / 0.2 = 2000 mL. However, this is the total volume of the 20% lipid emulsion, not the volume of fat itself. Since the emulsion is 20% fat, the volume of fat is 20% of the total volume: 20% * 2000 mL = 400 mL. But we still need to find the volume of the 20% lipid emulsion, not just the volume of fat. Therefore, the volume of the 20% lipid emulsion is 400 mL / 20% = 2000 mL / 0.2 = 10000 mL / 0.2 = 5000 mL. However, the given options do not include 5000 mL. The closest option is 3000 mL, which is closest to 5000 mL when rounded down.)</s>"
