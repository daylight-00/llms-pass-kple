The correct answer refers to the section where drying conditions are typically specified. In this context, the reference is made to the \"Loss on Drying\" section, as absorbance tests often require the sample to be dried to a constant weight similar to the procedure in Loss on Drying tests, where the temperature is specified. While \"Lukewarm,\" \"Room temperature,\" \"Ambient temperature,\" and \"Standard temperature\" are all plausible drying conditions, the question specifically asks for the condition related to the monograph's instructions, which is why the answer is directed to the \"Loss on Drying\" section, where such details are usually provided."

This is not one of the options provided. Upon re-evaluation, we realize that the question is asking for the incremental QALY gain specifically due to the new drug B, not the absolute difference.\n\nSince Drug B provides an additional 1 year of progression-free survival, we only consider the QALY gain during this additional year:\nAdditional QALY for Drug B = 1 year * 0.8 utility weight = 0.8 QALY\n\nHowever, this option is also not provided. The discrepancy arises from the initial calculation mistake. The correct approach is to compare the QALYs during the additional progression-free survival period, which is 1 year for Drug B compared to 0 years for Drug A.\n\nIncremental QALY for Drug B = 1 year * 0.8 utility weight = 0.8 QALY\n\nThis option is not listed, indicating an error in the question or the provided options. Nonetheless, based on the correct calculation, the answer should be 0.8 QALY, which is not among the given choices."

Since the calculated Cpk is 1.67, the process is considered to be marginally capable.\n\nThis means that the state is satisfactory, but caution is needed in management. The other options are incorrect because the process capability index indicates that the process is not very satisfactory, very unsatisfactory, or in an emergency state. Process improvement is not necessary based on the given information, but rather, management should be cautious to ensure that the process remains capable."

According to the criteria, certain medications are considered inappropriate for use in patients aged 65 and older due to the increased risk of adverse effects or lack of therapeutic benefit.\n\nIn this case, the patient is 70 years old and has multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, epilepsy, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The medication of concern, based on the Beers Criteria, is valproic acid (②). Valproic acid is listed as a potentially inappropriate medication for older adults due to its increased risk of causing serious adverse effects, such as bleeding, bruising, and hematologic abnormalities, as well as the risk of developing a rare but serious condition called hyponatremia (low sodium levels in the blood).\n\nThe other medications listed are not typically considered inappropriate for use in older adults with similar conditions:\n\n- Losartan (①) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used to treat hypertension and is generally well-tolerated in older adults.\n- Alfuzosin (③) is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia and is considered safe and effective in older adults.\n- Hydroxyzine (④) is an antihistamine used for pruritus and headache, and while it can have sedative effects, it is not specifically listed as inappropriate for older adults.\n- Acetaminophen (⑤) is a pain reliever and fever reducer that is generally considered safe for use in older adults when used at recommended doses.\n\nTherefore, based on the Beers Criteria, valproic acid (②) should be inquired about to the physician regarding the appropriateness of drug selection for this patient."

This makes Case 1's research method generally advantageous in terms of a shorter research period and lower cost.\n\nWhy other options are not correct:\n① It has high internal validity - This is not necessarily an advantage for Case 1 over Case 2, as both cases aim to establish a causal relationship, and internal validity is a desirable feature for both.\n② It is easy to calculate disease incidence rates and risk factors - This is more applicable to Case 2, as it involves a long-term follow-up to calculate incidence rates and risk factors.\n④ It is possible to observe the occurrence of various diseases according to exposure to risk factors - This is more applicable to Case 2, as it focuses on a wide range of diseases (lung cancer) over a long period.\n⑤ The entire process from exposure to risk factors to disease occurrence can be observed - This is more applicable to Case 2, as it aims to observe the development of lung cancer over a long period."

While the initial management includes antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and nitrates for pain relief, the presence of elevated triglycerides (TG 180 mg/dL) and low HDL-C (59 mg/dL) indicate a higher risk of atherosclerotic disease, which is a common cause of recurrent myocardial infarction. Apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), is indicated for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation but is also effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with prior myocardial infarction, especially those with high triglyceride levels and low HDL-C.\n\nAdding apixaban to the patient's regimen can help reduce the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and, consequently, the frequency of chest pain. The other options (increasing lisinopril, carvedilol doses, or adding morphine or nimodipine) are not directly related to addressing the risk factors for recurrent ischemia or the specific need for anticoagulation in this context."
